<h2><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s search for wealth has taken him to many out of the way places.
Wealth can assume many forms, depending on the person striving for it.</p>
<p>What is now Jackson Hole was a way of life to the Indians who
summered here and wintered in the lower and warmer regions to the
east of Togwotee Pass. A summer in this secluded valley meant plentiful
fish and other wildlife for food, skins for clothing and teepees as
well as a cool, well-watered environment.</p>
<p>Snowmelt fed streams, bordered by vegetation, supported many beaver
and other fur bearers that attracted men of European descent in their
never-ending quest of commercial wealth. Colter was followed by other
mountain men and trappers who considered the natural resources of the
area as there to be taken for their own personal gain. By 1840 beaver
became scarce and fell from fashion. The land that supported bison
was thought good for domestic cattle, so ranchers settled in Jackson
Hole from one end to the other. Dry years and the Great Depression
forced many of them to sell out.</p>
<p>Now millions of visitors come each year to recapture the thrill of
wandering in a land still much as the Indians left it. This is a new
wealth that depreciates little under protection as a National Park.</p>
<p>An increasing number of people look for ways to identify themselves
with those who led the way into this new land. <i>Campfire Tales of
Jackson Hole</i> gives you this opportunity in an easy to read text that
takes you back to the people and events that transpired in the valley
that surrounds you.</p>

<br />THE DISCOVERY OF JACKSON HOLE AND THE YELLOWSTONE
<br /><span class="smaller">By <span class="sc">Merlin K. Potts</span>, <i>former Chief Park Naturalist</i></span></h2>
<p>To John Colter, mountain man, trapper, and lone wanderer in the exploration
of the Rocky Mountain wilderness, belongs the distinction of being the first white
man to enter Jackson Hole and the &ldquo;Country of the Yellowstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His biographers record that Colter was a descendant of Micajah Coalter,
Scotsman, who settled in Virginia about 1700. That John was born in Virginia is
not definitely known, but there is no evidence to indicate that any of the Coalters,
from John&rsquo;s great-great-grandfather to his own generation, ever lived elsewhere.
He was born toward the close of the 18th Century, probably about 1775. There are
no records of Colter&rsquo;s early life, other than to indicate emigration to Kentucky
with other members of the family before 1803. History marks his first appearance
with his enlistment in the Lewis and Clark Expedition of October 15 of that year.
He proved to be a skillful hunter, a faithful and reliable employee, popular with
his commanders and the other men of the Expedition. He served with Lewis and
Clark on the westward journey, and was returning to St. Louis in August 1806
when the party, commanded by Captain Clark, encountered 2 trappers enroute
to a winter&rsquo;s sojourn on the upper Missouri. Colter expressed a desire to join these
men, and was released from the Expedition to do so. The partnership dissolved in
the spring of 1807, after what appears to have been an unsuccessful venture,
insofar as peltry was concerned, but undoubtedly rewarding experience wise.</p>
<p>Colter again started for St. Louis, by canoe, down the Missouri. By now he
was an experienced hand in unknown country. Moving alone and matching his skills
against the hazards and rigors of the land were no more than everyday occurrences.
As he swept down the turbid river, swollen by spring flood waters, his intention
was to return to the civilization he had left 3 years before. Once again his plans
were altered by chance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>A young Spaniard, Manuel Lisa, engaged in the fur trade in St. Louis, and
influenced by reports of the abundance of beaver on the upper Missouri, had
determined to explore the possibilities of extending his operations in that hitherto
unexploited region. Accordingly, he organized a brigade and set forth up river.
Colter met the party, and was persuaded by Lisa to join him. Lisa, a shrewd trader,
was not a frontiersman. He recognized in Colter exactly the type of man he needed,
and quite probably the inducements he offered were considerable. Yet, to a man of
Colter&rsquo;s stamp, the financial gain possible was secondary to the prospect of further
opportunity for adventure. We can surmise that Lisa experienced little difficulty in
influencing the young and venturesome trapper to turn his back again on the
doubtful attractions of the settlements.</p>
<p>It was late in November of that year, 1807, before Lisa selected a site for his
trading post, at the confluence of the Yellowstone and Big Horn Rivers, in what
is now south-central Montana. Construction of the post was begun immediately.
Lisa named it Fort Raymond, after his son, but it was more generally known as
Manuel&rsquo;s Fort.</p>
<p>It was Lisa&rsquo;s objective, not only to trap, but to engage in trade with the
Indians, and to learn as much as possible about the trapping territory to the west.
Of his men, Colter was the best suited to seek out the tribesmen, encourage them
to trade at the post, and survey the lands with an eye to its productivity in fur.
Thus Lisa instructed him, outfitted him, and sent him forth.</p>
<p>It could not have been earlier than late November when Colter set out. His
equipment must have been meager; snowshoes, his gun, ammunition, a blanket
or robe, and little or no food, since he would have intended to &ldquo;live off the land&rdquo;
and his pack would likely not have exceeded 30 pounds, including &ldquo;geegaws&rdquo; for
the Indians he encountered.</p>
<p>His exact route has long been a matter for conjecture among historians. He
was to venture into country unknown to any other than the Indians, he carried no
maps, he followed what must have appeared to him to be the route of least
resistance, insofar as he could judge the terrain he traversed. He, from force of
circumstance, must have followed the watercourses and game trails, sought the
lowest mountain passes he could find, pursuing a devious course which led him to
the south and west.</p>
<p>In the light of Colter&rsquo;s own later attempt to trace his route for Captain Clark,
and through our knowledge of today&rsquo;s maps, it can be assumed, with a fair degree
of reliability, that he moved across country to Pryor&rsquo;s Fork, up that stream and down
Gap Creek to its junction with the Big Horn, thence up the Big Horn to the
Shoshone (Stinking Water). He followed the course of the Shoshone upstream to
the vicinity of what is now Cody, Wyoming, and along the base of the Absaroka
Mountains into the Wind River Valley, striking the Wind probably some distance
south and east of present day Dubois.</p>
<p>It appears that it was on the Stinking Water that Colter discovered the area
which his contemporaries of the trapping fraternity derisively named &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell,&rdquo;
after Colter&rsquo;s description of the thermal features there. Historians writing many
years later, perhaps more romantically than accurately, attributed Colter&rsquo;s reference
to one or more of the now famous geyser and hot springs sections of the Yellowstone.
It makes a better story thus, but the preponderance of evidence from the
accounts of the trappers themselves places &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&rdquo; in the vicinity of the
DeMaris Springs, near Cody. Geological indications are that the area was much
more active, insofar as thermal phenomena are concerned, then than now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Two excellent early authorities confirm this location of &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell.&rdquo; As
set forth in Burton Harris&rsquo; <i>John Colter, His Years in the Rockies</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As late as 1848, the accomplished Belgian priest, Father DeSmet, placed Colter&rsquo;s
Hell on the Stinking Water on the strength of information obtained from the few
trappers who were left in the mountains at that date. The courageous priest, known
as &ldquo;Black Robe&rdquo; to the Indians, was on his way to visit the Sioux in 1848 when he
wrote the following account: &ldquo;Near the source of the River Puante (Stinking Water,
now called Shoshone) which empties into the Big Horn, and the sulphurous waters of
which have probably the same medicinal qualities as the celebrated Blue Lick Springs
of Kentucky, is a place called Colter&rsquo;s Hell&mdash;from a beaver hunter of that name. This
locality is often agitated with subterranean fires. The sulphurous gases which escape in
great volumes from the burning soil infect the atmosphere for several miles, and
render the earth so barren that even the wild wormwood cannot grow on it. The
beaver hunters have assured me that the frequent underground noises and explosions
are frightful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Washington Irving, in <i>The Rocky Mountains</i>: (1837) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Crow country has other natural curiosities, which are held in superstitious awe
by the Indians, and considered great marvels by the trappers. Such is the Burning
Mountain, on Powder River, abounding with anthracite coal. Here the earth is hot
and cracked; in many places emitting smoke and sulphurous vapors, as if covering
concealed fires. A volcanic tract of similar character is found on Stinking River, one
of the tributaries of the Big Horn, which takes its unhappy name from the odor
derived from sulphurous springs and streams. This last mentioned place was first discovered
by Colter, a hunter belonging to Lewis and Clark&rsquo;s exploring party, who came
upon it in the course of his lonely wanderings, and gave such an account of its gloomy
terrors, its hidden fires, smoking pits, noxious streams, and the all-pervading &ldquo;smell of
brimstone,&rdquo; that it received, and has ever since retained among the trappers, the name
of &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon reaching the valley of the Wind, it would have been logical for Colter&rsquo;s
route to have been north and west over the Wind River Mountains through Union
Pass, the easiest available, at an elevation of 9,210 feet. Here historians have indulged
in a long standing, and unresolvable debate, some authorities contending
that he would probably have followed up the Little Wind River, crossing the Wind
River Mountains further north, at Togwotee Pass. Whichever route he used to the
westward&mdash;Union Pass and the Gros Ventre River drainage, or Togwotee Pass
and Blackrock Creek&mdash;either brought him into Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that in any event his course was a circuitous one,
following the twistings and turnings of many water courses, deviating along Indian
trails to the winter encampments of the Crows, attentive to his instructions from
Manuel Lisa. Quite probably the friendly Crows aided Colter by directing him to
routes of easy passage, perhaps accompanying him over parts of his journey, though
history makes no mention of this.</p>
<p>Entering Jackson Hole on its eastern margin, Colter saw before him a scene
of unsurpassed grandeur. At this season, which must have been well into December,
the floor of the Hole presented a broad expanse of snow-blanketed valley, broken
only by the forested buttes, looming black against the glistening white, and the
timbered water courses, marked by cottonwood, willow, and spruce. No smoke of
Indian village lifted above thickets. The tribesmen had moved to areas of less rigorous
climate, east, south, or west, weeks before. The soaring peaks, lifting their
gleaming spires across the valley, their canyons deep shadowed in blue gloom,
stretched for miles to the north and south. Even his stout heart must have faltered,
at least momentarily, at the grim barrier ahead.</p>
<p>Other than the Snake River Canyon, a route which he could hardly have anticipated
from any vantage point, he would logically have selected Teton Pass as the
most feasible crossing of the Teton Range to the southwest. Here the historians, at
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
least those who accept the theory of a trans-Teton route, are in almost unanimous
agreement, although some would have us believe that he made a frontal assault
through Cascade Canyon. This hardly seems likely, since Colter, bold as he was,
evidenced no characteristics of the foolhardy, and to his eyes the Cascade Canyon
route could scarcely have appeared to offer a feasible crossing.</p>
<p>One cannot but puzzle a bit, however, as to his reason for crossing the Range
at all. From the broad valley of the Hole the route northward up the Snake River
into the Yellowstone was to any eye an easy one. The terrain sloped gently, there
were no mountain walls to scale or circle, nothing to indicate any obstacle of consequence.
Indeed, many notable historical scholars have opposed the Teton Pass theory,
asserting that he did avoid the Tetons by moving northward. He would certainly
have fulfilled Lisa&rsquo;s orders to contact nearby Indian tribes by the time he had
reached Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>Accepting the Teton route, as we must in the light of later evidence, we add
further stature to Colter&rsquo;s perseverance and venturesome spirit. He went over the
mountains, perhaps because the Indians had described the route and country beyond
to him, perhaps because he was seeking the reported &ldquo;Spanish Settlements&rdquo; on the
headwaters of the Colorado River (Green River), or perhaps for the very simple
reason that he wanted to see what was on the other side.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Idaho side of the Range has given us the first really tangible
clue as to Colter&rsquo;s whereabouts while on his winter journey. In 1930, about
4 miles east of the Idaho village of Tetonia, was found the &ldquo;Colter Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of that year, while plowing virgin land on his father&rsquo;s homestead,
William Richard Beard, then a boy of 16, unearthed the stone from its resting place
about 18 inches beneath the surface. His attention was first attracted by the shape
of the rock. It had been roughly formed to resemble a human head, flattened, but with
the unmistakeable outline of forehead, nose, lips, and chin. When the stone had
been cleaned, it was found to have been crudely carved. One side bore the name
&ldquo;JOHN COLTER,&rdquo; the other was inscribed with the almost illegible figures,
&ldquo;1808.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="254" />
<p class="pcap">The &ldquo;Colter Stone,&rdquo; with Colter&rsquo;s name inscribed on one face, the barely legible
date 1808 on the other. Found near Tetonia, Idaho, in 1930, the stone is now
on display in the History Museum exhibits at the Moose Visitor Center, Park
Headquarters, Grand Teton National Park.</p>
</div>
<p>The slab of gray, rhyolite lava from which the stone was shaped is soft and
easily worked. It would have taken no great amount of labor to have accomplished
the job. Perhaps it provided a means of passing time while Colter was blizzard-bound,
or merely loafing in camp, taking a well-earned respite from days of arduous
travel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Immediately after the stone was given to the National Park Service in 1933 by
Mr. Aubrey C. Lyon, who had acquired it from the Beards, a controversy developed
as to its authenticity. The carving of stones and tree trunks by early trappers and
explorers was a well-established practice; several such evidences of their passing
have been found. There have been hoaxes revealed also, and there were those who
refused to accept the Colter Stone as valid. The evidence, what little there was to
investigate, was carefully analyzed. There was no duplicity remotely connected with
the finding of the stone. The Beards had never heard of John Colter. It had
rested at a depth of some several inches beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface. Certainly
Colter would not have carved it, then buried it, so the accumulation of soil above
the stone must have been the result of some years, and the stone had weathered
before burial, it could hardly have weathered after being covered by earth. In the
final analysis, it seems most illogical that anyone mischievously inclined would have
been sufficiently informed to perpetrate a hoax at such a remote spot. A prankster
would have deposited his bogus relic in a place where he could reasonably expect its
ready discovery. Else why bother?</p>
<p>The stone now reposes in the Fur Trade Museum at Park Headquarters, Grand
Teton National Park, as mute evidence that Colter did indeed &ldquo;pass this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colter&rsquo;s route, from the discovery of &ldquo;his&rdquo; stone, appears to have led northward
along the base of the western side of the Teton Range, until he perceived the next
comparatively easy route for a return toward the east. Recrossing the Tetons he
struck the western shore of Yellowstone Lake, called &ldquo;Lake Eustis&rdquo; on William
Clark&rsquo;s &ldquo;Map of the West,&rdquo; published in 1814. Tracing the route outlined on this
inaccurate map, historical scholars propound that he followed the Yellowstone River
to a crossing near Tower Falls, up the Lamar River and Soda Butte Creek, and
back across the Absaroka Range. By way then of Clark&rsquo;s Fork and Pryor&rsquo;s Fork
he made his way back to Manuel&rsquo;s Fort, arriving early in 1808.</p>
<p>So ended a most remarkable tour of some 500 miles, most of it made during the
winter months. Aside from the rigors of winter climate, foot travel, on snowshoes,
must have proved easier, with underbrush buried beneath the snow, than hiking
in summer over the same route.</p>
<p>That Colter made the journey, that he did traverse, in one way or another,
Jackson Hole and the Yellowstone Park area, has been challenged by few historians,
though all concede that his exact route will forever be a matter for speculation.
The unprovable can hardly be proven.</p>
<p>Though Colter has not been celebrated in history as have other famous
&ldquo;Mountain Men&rdquo; of a few years later, notably Jim Bridger, Bill Sublette, Joe Meek,
and Jedediah Smith, to name a few, he remained a notable figure among his fellows
until 1810.</p>
<p>It was in the spring or summer of 1808, following his return to Lisa&rsquo;s post,
that Colter had his first encounter with the Blackfeet. It was the custom of these
fierce and warlike Indians to send war parties south and west on forays into the
lands of their enemies, the Crows and other tribes. They were not, however,
particularly hostile to the whites, at least at this time.</p>
<p>Colter had again been dispatched by Lisa to &ldquo;drum up&rdquo; trade with the Indians.
While traveling with a large party of Flatheads and Crows, near the Three Forks
of the Missouri, Colter&rsquo;s band was attacked by a Blackfoot war party. In the battle
that ensued Colter was wounded, the Blackfeet were driven off, and the crippled
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Colter eventually managed to make his way back to Manuel&rsquo;s Fort. The Blackfeet
were enraged by the presence of a white man, however accidental it may have been,
fighting on the side of their traditional enemies. Colter&rsquo;s participation was apparently
the inspiration for the hostility of the Blackfeet toward the whites that followed,
and quite probably their hatred of Colter himself, which led to his most famous
adventure.</p>
<p>Every school boy has read accounts of Colter&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;run.&rdquo; Early writers
made much of it, various versions have appeared in print, all essentially similar.
Summarized briefly the records indicate that Colter, in the company of one John
Potts, returned again in 1808 to the Three Forks country. Again he and his companion
had a &ldquo;run in&rdquo; with the Blackfeet. Surprised while setting their traps, Colter
was taken prisoner. Potts made the mistake of resistance against overwhelming odds
and was promptly riddled with arrows and bullets after shooting one of the Indians.
Colter was disarmed, stripped, and then released by his captors, with the indication
that he was to go. He had moved away from the Indians only a little way when
several young braves, armed with lances, started in pursuit. He began his run for
the Jefferson River, 5 or 6 miles away.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that many men ever ran better, certainly few have run for higher
stakes. After some miles Colter had outdistanced all save one of his pursuers, but
his strength was failing, it appeared that his desperate effort had been in vain. He
stopped in despair to face the oncoming savage, and as the warrior lunged, Colter
seized the lance, which broke in his hands. The Indian, off balance, fell, and Colter
killed him with the blade of the weapon.</p>
<p>With only a mile remaining to the stream, he turned to run again, and
managed to reach the river ahead of his enemies.</p>
<p>Here the accounts vary, one has it that Colter plunged into the stream and swam
under water to a nearby beaver house in which he took refuge. The other, and
probably more likely version, says he swam to an island and hid beneath a mass of
driftwood that had lodged against the shore.</p>
<p>Although the Indians searched for him for the remainder of the day, probing
the tangled mass of drift with poles and lances, Colter, in his place of concealment,
avoided detection. After nightfall he made his escape and began his trek of
nearly 300 miles back to Lisa&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Without weapons or any other means of obtaining food, he managed to reach
the fort several days later, in the last stages of exhaustion, feet lacerated and torn
by rocks and cactus spines, half starved and barely alive.</p>
<p>Colter made two more trips into the area of the Three Forks. Both times he
narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Blackfeet; several of his companions were
killed.</p>
<p>In 1810 Colter came to the decision that he had had enough of the Blackfeet,
narrow escapes, and the repeated loss of furs, traps, and equipment. He left the
country, this time to return to civilization without deviation or delay. He settled on a
little farm in Missouri, married, and lived there for his remaining years.</p>
<p>Colter died in 1813, reportedly from jaundice. The legal notice of the final
settlement of his estate placed its value at $229.41.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>So ended, at an age of only 38 years, the career of one of America&rsquo;s greatest
frontiersmen, a forerunner of the famous &ldquo;Mountain Men.&rdquo; Nevertheless, what a
lot of living and adventure Colter crammed into the short span of his 7 years
beyond the Missouri.</p>
<p>Colter&rsquo;s part in the early exploration of one of the most rugged sections of
America will forever stand as an heroic achievement. He was the West&rsquo;s first
great pathfinder, a fitting figure to set the pace for those who followed his lonely
paths into the wildest areas of the Far Western frontier.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">THE MOUNTAIN MEN IN JACKSON HOLE.</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">By <span class="sc">Merlin K. Potts</span>, <i>former Chief Park Naturalist</i></span></h2>
<p><span class="ss">MOUNTAIN MAN.</span> The very term has an aura of romance, and the mountain
man of the Fur Trade Era was a romantic character, as he most frequently appears in
the novels of the wild Far West. He also appears as an uncouth, illiterate, morally
degenerate, lazy lout, addicted to prolonged debauchery, often little better, sometimes
inferior, to the savages with whom he frequently associated. Between this
extreme, and the fearless, hardy, resourceful wanderer of the lonely plains and
mountain highlands, lies the true measure of these men of the mountains. Some were
as bad as they were painted, many were as fine as history describes them. They were
the products of their time, neither better, nor worse, than any cross-section of the
men of any time.</p>
<p>They were, none-the-less, unique even among the pioneers of their day. Their
chosen land was far beyond the outposts of the settlements, their fellows were few,
they moved through the most remote sections of America, often alone, sometimes
in the company of a handful of companions.</p>
<p>Mountain men were the first to explore the Far West; beyond the Missouri,
through the Rockies, across the Great American Desert, from the Southwest to
Canada, and to the Western Sea. They came not as explorers, such intent probably
never occurred to them. Their sole interest was in the quest for pelts, particularly
the fine fur of the beaver. Beaver hats were the vogue during the period of the
Western Fur Trade, roughly 1800-40. Until this headpiece was supplanted by the
silk hat, the trappers followed the fur, their trails crossing and recrossing virtually
every area where beaver were to be taken. Some were independent trappers, some
were attached to various fur companies. To the organizers of the trade, the &ldquo;business
men&rdquo; behind the enterprises, fell the financial rewards. The trappers, except in
rare instances, barely made a living at their profession. Their rewards were, many
times, an unmarked grave or broken health, a maimed and crippled body, or, if they
survived to a ripe old age of perhaps 60 years, memories of a lifetime of adventure
multiplied many times beyond the normal conception.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>They were indeed a breed of men apart. It is in no way remarkable that their
story is one of the most fascinating in our history. Bridger, Smith, Fitzpatrick, Carson,
Meek, Sublette, Jackson; these are among the famous names engraved upon
the face of the land, markers to the indomitable men who left behind these reminders
of the days when the beaver was king of the furbearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Hole,&rdquo; the great, mountain-encircled valley lying at the east base
of the Teton Range, was, as that excellent historian Mattes puts it so aptly, the
&ldquo;Crossroads of the Western Fur Trade.&rdquo; Trapper trails led into and out of the
valley from all directions, through the passes to the east, Two Ocean, Togwotee,
and Union, along the Hoback River to the south, through Teton and Conant
Passes at either end of the great range to the west, and along the valley of the Snake
and Lewis Rivers northward into the Yellowstone Country. From John Colter&rsquo;s
memorable trek in 1807-08 through 1840 there was much activity throughout the
region. With the decline of the fur trade the valley became once again, and for
many years thereafter, a place of solitude, unvisited, as far as history records, by
white men.</p>
<p>The name Jim Bridger is synonymous with mountain man. Few frontiersmen
from the time of Daniel Boone have so captured the imagination, or been so
voluminously treated in western lore. Bridger has been celebrated as the greatest
of them all, his true exploits tremendous, his fancied feats fantastic. There were
others who shared his fame, he was overshadowed by none, perhaps equaled by
a very few.</p>
<p>Bridger was born in Richmond, Virginia, on March 17, 1804, his birthday
antedating by less than 2 months the departure of Lewis and Clark on the first
great western exploration. The family emigrated a few years later to St. Louis, and
Jim and his younger sister were left in the care of an aunt when their mother and
father died in 1816 and 1817. By the time he was 14 young Jim was supporting himself
and his sister by operating a flatboat ferry, then he became an apprentice in the
blacksmith&rsquo;s trade. This mundane life was not for him. There were too many exotic
influences in the St. Louis of that time which had a tremendous attraction for a
teen-aged youngster. Indians on their ponies jogged along the streets; Mexican
muleteers and colorful Spaniards off the Santa Fe Trail strolled through the town;
there were boatmen, fur traders, and plainsmen with their tales of buffalo, Indian
fights, Lisa, Colter, Lewis and Clark; what boy could resist the lure of adventure
which beckoned so importunately just beyond the skyline. Jim could not, he did
not. Little sister was growing up, expenses were mounting, and there was a fortune
to be made beyond the western horizon.</p>
<p>In March 1822, just after Jim had passed his eighteenth birthday, the St. Louis
<i>Missouri Republican</i> carried the following notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Enterprising Young Men. The subscriber wishes to engage one hundred young
men to ascend the Missouri River to its source, there to be employed for one, two or
three years. For particulars inquire of Major Andrew Henry, near the lead mines in
the county of Washington, who will ascend with, and command, the party; or of the
subscriber near St. Louis.</p>
<p><span class="lr">(Signed) William H. Ashley</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No mention was made as to the employment for one, two or three years, nor
was it necessary. What else but the quest for fur! Young Jim signed on, and a
month later he was on his way to the promised land, one of the &ldquo;enterprising young
men&rdquo; of Henry&rsquo;s company, bound up the river by keelboat to become a trapper. He
was in distinguished company among experienced frontiersmen, though many of
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the crew were raw recruits, as green as Jim himself. There were Sublette and
Fitzpatrick, Davy Jackson and old Hugh Glass, the latter to figure prominently in
Jim&rsquo;s introduction to the frontier.</p>
<p>The outfit lost their horses, which had been traveling overland with a party
under General Ashley&rsquo;s command, to the Assiniboines, however, and as Ashley
returned to St. Louis, the balance of the command &ldquo;forted up&rdquo; at the mouth of the
Yellowstone that fall. This was &ldquo;Fort Union.&rdquo; Thus Jim became a &ldquo;Hivernant.&rdquo; He
wintered in the mountains and was a greenhorn no longer, when spring came he
was a Mountain Man.</p>
<p>With the breakup of the ice that spring, Major Henry promptly started on the
spring hunt, intending to combine trapping with trading with the Indians. The
party was jumped by Blackfeet at or near the Great Falls of the Missouri,
and the Indians drove them into retreat. They made their way back to the fort,
losing four men killed, and with several wounded. Bridger had his first taste of
Injun fightin&rsquo;. It was not a palatable one.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ashley had not arrived at the fort, but some time after the
return of Henry&rsquo;s party Jedediah Smith (also recruited by Ashley in the spring of
1822) arrived with one companion and the most unwelcome news that the
General&rsquo;s party had run into difficulty with the Arikaras, and was in dire need of
reinforcements. Henry, with about 80 of his men, including Bridger, returned with
Smith to aid Ashley, arriving in time to achieve a doubtful and shortlived truce
with the Indians, with the help of Colonel Leavenworth and a force of soldiers,
trappers, and friendly Sioux, who had moved up from Fort Atkinson.</p>
<p>Major Henry and his men, having received their supplies from Ashley,
set out at once for the fort on the Yellowstone, intending to again proceed from
there into the wilderness in search of furs. Shortly after the Arikara fight
occurred an incident that was to have a pronounced and lasting influence on young
Jim. The aforementioned Hugh Glass was a hunter for the party, an elderly, tough
Pennsylvanian. On the occasion which led to his claim to fame as a victim of one
of the most tragic &ldquo;bear stories&rdquo; ever related, he was ahead of the party on a
hunt, when he was attacked and mauled by a she-grizzly. So severely was the old
man mangled that his companions despaired of his life. Here was a knotty problem.
He could not be moved, he could not be left alone. Yet the party wanted to get
out of the hostile Indian country and go about the business of collecting furs
as speedily as possible. Major Henry decided that two men must remain with old
Hugh until he died. No one wanted to stay, but the Major proposed that every
man contribute a dollar as an inducement to those left behind with the old man.
The men were more than willing to subscribe to the arrangement, Jim volunteered
to stay, and another, Fitzgerald by name, reluctantly consented to remain also.
So it was determined, and the Major and the rest of the party moved on.</p>
<p>Old Hugh clung tenaciously to life, while Jim and Fitzgerald sat and
fretted, constantly in fear of discovery and attack by the hostile Arikaras.
Fitzgerald found Indian sign on the third day. As far as he was concerned that
clinched it, they couldn&rsquo;t do the old man any good, he was certain to &ldquo;go under&rdquo;
anyway, in the meantime they were in terrible danger. He finally persuaded Jim
to leave the dying oldster, taking with them Glass&rsquo; rifle, powder, knife, all
his &ldquo;fixins,&rdquo; because it wouldn&rsquo;t be reasonable to show up without them, they
wouldn&rsquo;t leave the things with a dead man, and their story to the Major would
have to be that Glass had died. The old fellow was barely conscious, and they
slipped away, catching up to the rest of the party just before it reached the
fort on the Yellowstone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Jim was worried, memories of the old man haunted him, suppose he hadn&rsquo;t
died! Imagine his dismay when a few weeks later Glass appeared in the trappers&rsquo;
camp. Jim expected death at the hands of the hunter, he probably felt that he
deserved it, but Glass seemed to be most interested in the whereabouts of Fitzgerald,
placing the blame on him.</p>
<p>Glass had an incredible story to tell. Realizing that he had been deserted,
he determined to save himself, and crawling, hobbling, barely able to move at
all, he started for Fort Kiowa, nearly 100 miles away. He made it, and as soon
as possible thereafter he started upriver again to locate Henry&rsquo;s party. He wanted
&ldquo;Fitz.&rdquo; When he learned that Fitzgerald had left the Major and gone downriver
to Fort Atkinson, Glass went after him, with the avowed intention of revenge. He
found him, but found also that he had joined the Army. The commanding
officer at Fort Atkinson heard his story, persuaded him that shooting a soldier would
be a serious matter, compelled Fitzgerald to make good the old man&rsquo;s losses, and
thus the matter was ended, perhaps not to the complete satisfaction of the justly
irate old hunter, but at least without bloodshed. Jim never forgot. The rest of his
life the lesson remained with him, and his record of service to others, devotion
to duty rather than self-interest, is sufficient evidence that the lesson was well
learned.</p>
<p>Bridger&rsquo;s exploits in the years that followed were legion. In 1824 he explored
the Bear River, discovering the Great Salt Lake which at that time he believed to
be an arm of the Pacific. He advanced from a trapper in the employ of others to
a partnership in the Rocky Mountain Fur Company with Fitzpatrick, Milton Sublette,
Fraeb and Gervais, when in 1830 they brought out the company of Jedediah
Smith, David Jackson, and Bill Sublette. He is best known for his services as a
guide. As his knowledge of the Rockies increased with his years of wandering over
the west, he repeatedly served as a scout for the Army, in which capacity he was
invaluable, his knowledge of Indians and their ways was second to none. He guided
many notable expeditions, one of them the Raynolds party, into Jackson Hole. It
was said of him that he could brush clear a patch of earth and inscribe thereon,
with a twig, an accurate and detailed map of any section of the Northern Rockies,
depending only upon a photographic memory of the terrain.</p>
<p>Bridger visited Jackson Hole for the first time in 1825, with Thomas Fitzpatrick
and 30 trappers, following Jedediah Smith&rsquo;s route of the previous year,
that is by way of the Hoback River from the south. They passed through the Hole,
going north along the Snake River into the Yellowstone. This was probably the
first trapping venture with Jackson Hole as the center of operations. Mattes says,
in <i>Jackson Hole, Crossroads of the Fur Trade, 1807-1840</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was a notable occasion, for the full glory of the Tetons was then revealed
for the first time to these two young fur trappers who were destined in later years to
become famous as guides for the government explorers and the emigrant trains, and as
scouts for the Indian-fighting armies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bridger&rsquo;s trails, and those of many others, crossed and recrossed the valley at
the foot of the Tetons many times in the ensuing several years, as they moved to
and from the rendezvous sites on Bear River, the Green, Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, and the
Wind. Through this period the Hole justified its designation as the &ldquo;crossroads.&rdquo;
Traffic was heavy, and upon at least one occasion, following the Pierre&rsquo;s Hole
rendezvous of 1832, two men (not with Bridger) were killed by the Blackfeet near
the mouth of the Hoback. These men did not, for a time, attain even the &ldquo;unmarked
grave&rdquo; reward. Their bones were discovered and buried the following August by
men of the American Fur Company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Bridger&rsquo;s fame as a Rocky Mountain guide was well established by 1859, when
he was employed by Captain W. F. Raynolds, of the Corps of Engineers of the
U. S. Army, to assist his expedition in the exploration of the Yellowstone and
all its tributaries. The Raynolds expedition left St. Louis on May 28, 1859, and
included about 15 scientific men, one of whom was the later renowned Ferdinand
V. Hayden. The expedition wintered on the Platte near the present site of Glenrock,
Wyoming.</p>
<p>During the several months that Raynolds and his men were idling away the
winter, Bridger&rsquo;s stories of the Yellowstone aroused in Raynolds an intense desire
to see these wonders for himself, and he determined to do so. The old guide and his
leader were both to suffer keen disappointment. The party left the winter camp on
May 6, 1860, and headed for the Wind River country, eventually reaching Union
Pass, so named by Captain Raynolds because he thought it was near the geographic
center of the Continent, on May 31. Bridger and the Captain reconnoitered to the
north, but found the route discovered by Bridger in previous years, Two Ocean Pass,
blocked by snow too deep to negotiate. They were thus forced, to their profound
regret, to continue on down the Gros Ventre, entering Jackson Hole on June 11. So
Raynolds was unable to verify Bridger&rsquo;s tales of the wonders of the Yellowstone,
marvels that Jim was as anxious for him to see as the Captain was to see them.</p>
<p>The Snake River was a raging torrent, but a boat was contrived of blankets and
a lodge-skin of Bridger&rsquo;s stretched over a framework of poles. The animals were
persuaded to swim the river, and the party eventually managed the crossing. One man
was drowned, however, while trying to find a ford. Raynolds and his men left
Jackson Hole by way of Teton Pass and proceeded north through Pierre&rsquo;s Hole.</p>
<p>Although Bridger was engaged as a guide for many subsequent explorations,
including a survey of a more direct stage and freight route between Denver and
Salt Lake City, he did not come again to Jackson Hole. He made his last scout for
the Army in 1868.</p>
<p>Bridger&rsquo;s name appears on landmarks and features throughout the Rockies.
In Wyoming there is Bridger&rsquo;s Pass across the Continental Divide a short distance
southwest of Rawlins; Fort Bridger, a small town on U.S. Highway 30 near the
site of the Fort established by Bridger in 1843; the Bridger National Forest, and
Bridger Lake near the southeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park, to name
only a few.</p>
<p>Bridger&rsquo;s &ldquo;home&rdquo; was in the mountains he loved. He bought property near
Kansas City, a small farm and a home in Westport, where various members of his
family lived, but Jim spent little time there until his declining years. He had a large
family, was survived by four children from his Indian wives. Jim didn&rsquo;t believe in
the practice of plural marriage, as many of the mountain men did. He was married
three times, successively to women of the Flathead, Ute, and Snake tribes, his
third wife died in 1858. He was a good family man. His children were sent to
school in the east, except for one daughter, Mary Ann, who was placed in the
Whitman Mission School at Waiilatpu, Oregon, and who died tragically in the
Whitman Massacre of 1847.</p>
<p>Jim Bridger&rsquo;s yarns of the west have long been famous. He could supply facts,
when facts were needed, but he loved to embroider his facts into fanciful tales for
the edification and delight of the &ldquo;greenhorns,&rdquo; to some extent because his facts
were sometimes doubted. One of his greatest stories concerned the petrified forest
of the Yellowstone. According to Jim not only the trees were &ldquo;peetrified,&rdquo; but
there were &ldquo;peetrified birds asettin&rsquo; on the peetrified limbs asingin&rsquo; peetrified songs.&rdquo;
One time he was riding through this section when he came to a sheer precipice. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
was upon it so suddenly that he was unable to check his horse, which walked off
the cliff into space and proceeded on its way because even gravity had &ldquo;peetrified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim died on July 17, 1881. His last years were not pleasant. He had a goitre
from which he suffered, rheumatic miseries plagued him, and his sight failed. By
1875 he was totally blind. As his old eyes grew dim he longed for his mountains,
he said a man could see so much farther in that country.</p>
<p>His old friend, General Grenville M. Dodge, had erected above his grave
in Mount Washington Cemetery in Kansas City a memorial monument which bears
the inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1804-James Bridger-1881. Celebrated as a hunter, trapper, fur trader and guide.
Discovered Great Salt Lake 1824, the South Pass 1827. Visited Yellowstone Lake and
Geysers 1830. Founded Fort Bridger 1843. Opened Overland Route by Bridger&rsquo;s Pass
to Great Salt Lake. Was a guide for U. S. exploring expeditions, Albert Sidney Johnston&rsquo;s
army in 1857, and G. M. Dodge in U.P. surveys and Indian campaigns 1865-66.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jedediah Strong Smith, a contemporary of Bridger&rsquo;s, was another of General
Ashley&rsquo;s &ldquo;enterprising young men&rdquo; who came west with the General and Major
Henry in 1822. He was one of the rawest of the green hands, yet was one of the
first to attain stature. He was older than Bridger by 5 years, head of an Ashley party
at the end of one year on the frontier, in 2 years a partner with the General, and in
3 the senior partner of the fur-trading company of Smith, Sublette, and Jackson.</p>
<p>To say that Smith was second only to Bridger in his prominence as a mountain
man, to attempt to place any of the leaders among the trappers in any order of rank
or importance, would be like trying to rate the military commanders of history. Each
in his own rugged individualistic way moved toward his own destiny. Many would
have risen to even greater fame than they achieved, had they not met with misfortune
early in their careers. So, we may assume, it might have been with Smith. He was
already a famous figure in the West at the time of his untimely death in 1831.</p>
<p>He was an unusual type of man to be a frontiersman, most would have said
it was unlikely that he would last long or rise to any prominence in the rough,
brawling, blood-and-thunder ways of the west of that day. He did not smoke or
chew tobacco, was never profane, and rarely drank any spirituous liquor. He was
a profoundly religious man, always carried his Bible with him, and allowed nothing
to shake or alter his religious beliefs. For his day he was also a well-educated man,
and one of the few who kept a journal, in which he recorded in some detail his
experiences.</p>
<p>For all this divergence from the usual ways of his fellows, he was respected
and admired, accepted by the other trappers, affectionately known as &ldquo;Old Jed&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Diah,&rdquo; and even upon occasion referred to as Mr. Smith. He was the first of the
trapping fraternity to reach California overland from the Rockies, the first across the
Sierras, and the first to reach Oregon by way of the West Coast.</p>
<p>When Henry had established his fort at the confluence of the Yellowstone and
the Missouri in 1822, Smith was sent back to St. Louis to advise General Ashley
of the needs of Henry and his men for the following year. Smith then accompanied
Ashley west in the spring of 1823, and as mentioned previously, was sent ahead to
enlist Henry&rsquo;s aid when Ashley ran into trouble with the Arikaras. He again returned
with the General to St. Louis, and in February 1824, Ashley sent him out again
with a party which traveled overland by pack train. On this occasion Smith and
his party made the first crossing, east to west, of the famous South Pass at the head
of the Sweetwater River, the pass which was to become the crossing of the Great
Divide on the Oregon Trail. This pass had been used by the Astorians, traveling in
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the opposite direction, in 1812. (General Dodge&rsquo;s memorial, crediting discovery of
the pass to Bridger in 1827, was thus in error, although various routes were being
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo; and &ldquo;re-discovered&rdquo; at intervals by individuals who had no knowledge
that others had preceded them.) A new era in fur trade history was opened when
Smith&rsquo;s party found the rich beaver fields at the head of Green River. As Smith and
his contingent moved north from the Green, they entered Jackson Hole by way of
the Hoback, passed through the valley, and crossed north of the Tetons by way of
Conant Pass into Pierre&rsquo;s Hole (the Teton Basin.) Thus Smith preceded Bridger
into Jackson Hole by a year.</p>
<p>Although Smith became possibly the greatest of the trapper-explorers, at
least with relation to the wide territory covered in the course of his journeys, he
did not return to Jackson Hole. He was killed by Comanches only 7 years later on
the Santa Fe Trail. Crossing desert country with a wagon train, Smith was scouting
ahead for water when he was slain. His remains were never found, the story of his
death came to light when Mexican traders, who dealt with the Comanches, brought
his pistols and rifle to Santa Fe.</p>
<p>William &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Sublette and David E. Jackson became Smith&rsquo;s partners in the
fur trade when they bought Ashley&rsquo;s interests in the business at the rendezvous near
the Great Salt Lake in 1826. Both of these men had been among those who made
up Ashley&rsquo;s 1822 expedition, Sublette at that time was 24 years of age, a Kentuckian
whose family moved to Missouri in 1817. Jackson has remained throughout the
years an enigma, practically nothing is known of him before his advent into
the fur trade, or following his activity as a mountain man.</p>
<p>Sublette was the entrepreneur of the trio. It was Bill who handled the outfitting,
the business contracts, the transportation of trade goods and furs. That
the partnership was successful is indicated by their disposal of their interests to
Bridger and his partners in 1830 for an overall sum involving some $16,000.
Sublette and his partners were shrewd enough to anticipate the gradual dissolution
of the fur trade, which influenced their desire to get out of the business. It was
Sublette&rsquo;s wagon caravan from St. Louis to the Popo Agie and return in 1830 that
proved the overland trail could be used by wheeled vehicles, this was the caravan
that pioneered the immigrants&rsquo; route to Oregon. Sublette later returned to the west
as a trader, in partnership with Robert Campbell, and built Fort William (later Fort
Laramie) in 1834.</p>
<p>Sublette and Jackson first entered Jackson Hole in 1826, after the rendezvous
of that year near the Great Salt Lake. They crossed the lower end of the valley on
their way to Green River, while their new partner, Smith, was headed with another
contingent of trappers southwest across the desert toward California.</p>
<p>The system of trading at annual summer &ldquo;rendezvous,&rdquo; several of which have
been previously mentioned, was inaugurated by Ashley in 1825. The rendezvous
site of that year was on Henry&rsquo;s Fork of the Green River. By such a method, more
flexible than the previously used &ldquo;fixed fort&rdquo; system, the trappers assembled at a
previously determined place, conveniently located for the widely separated trapper
bands. The trader brought his goods to the site where furs were exchanged for the
trade goods. It was a time of celebration, frolic, and general carousal for all concerned.
The rendezvous site can be likened to the hub of a wheel, the trails followed
by the trappers as they came in from the spring hunt and departed for the fall hunt
were the spokes. Thus rendezvous sites were on the Green, Wind, Popo Agie Rivers,
at the Bear and Great Salt Lakes, in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, and finally at Fort Bonneville.
Jackson Hole was never a rendezvous site because of the difficulty of access for
the traders over the high mountain passes surrounding the valley.</p>

<br />A fur brigade in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole (Teton Basin, Idaho), at the western base of
the Teton Range</p>
</div>
<p>There is no positive evidence of trapping activity in the valley in 1827-28,
although it is quite probable that the Hole received its share of attention. In 1829,
however, Sublette and Jackson joined forces again in Jackson Hole, where by
previous arrangement they were to meet &ldquo;Diah.&rdquo; Smith did not appear, and the
partners were greatly concerned by his absence. Tradition has it that Sublette named
&ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Hole&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Lake&rdquo; in honor of his associate while they were
encamped on the shore of the lake waiting for Smith. Smith was eventually located
in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole by one of the Sublette-Jackson party, Joe Meek, and the partners
were finally reunited there, Jackson and Sublette moving over via Teton Pass.</p>
<p>Throughout the period 1811-40, nearly every mountain man prominently connected
with the fur trade visited Jackson Hole. It was an area greatly favored by
Jackson, which undoubtedly accounts for Sublette&rsquo;s most appropriate name. Following
Colter&rsquo;s discovery of the valley, it was traversed in 1811 by three employees of
the St. Louis-Missouri Fur Company, John Hoback, Edward Robinson, and Jacob
Reznor. These three, en route to St. Louis in the spring, encountered the Astorian
expedition (John Jacob Astor&rsquo;s overland party of the American Fur Company) and
agreed to guide the party, commanded by Wilson Price Hunt, over a part of the
westward route. This group entered Jackson Hole that fall by way of the Hoback
River, then went west over Teton Pass. Robert Stuart brought a returning band
of Astorians back in the fall of 1812, following the same general way and discovering
the &ldquo;South Pass,&rdquo; as they moved eastward beyond the Green.</p>
<p>British interests took the initiative in the exploration of the fur country following
the War of 1812 and a general, and temporary, decline of American interest.
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
In 1819 Donald McKenzie of the Northwest Company brought a large party
through Jackson Hole and on north into the Yellowstone.</p>
<p>The Americans again entered the picture with Smith&rsquo;s previously mentioned
venture of 1824, and from that time forward the list of Jackson Hole visitors reads
like a &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who&rdquo; of the western fur trade. There were James Beckwourth (with
Sublette), all of Bridger&rsquo;s partners (Fitzpatrick, Milton Sublette, Fraeb, and
Gervais), Nathaniel Wyeth, Captain Benjamin L. E. Bonneville, and probably on
one occasion the redoubtable Kit Carson.</p>
<p>The era of the mountain man was brief. It is doubtful that the trappers, traders,
and fur company men realized the significance of their exploits in the expansion
westward of a new nation. Yet without their activities the exploration of the
western lands might have been long delayed, and the claim of the United States
to the Pacific Northwest much less secure.</p>

<p>The foregoing orders initiated one of the most unusual and bizarre expeditions
in the history of the west. Unusual because of the lack of judgment shown in
selecting late fall and winter for the journey; bizzarre in the impracticability, in
fact the impossibility, of execution of the orders.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gustavus C. Doane, selected to lead the party, was without question
as capable a leader as could have been chosen. Lieutenant Doane had been detailed,
with 5 cavalrymen, to accompany General Henry D. Washburn, Nathaniel Pitt
Langford, and their party of 1870 on the memorable exploration of the area
destined to become Yellowstone National Park 2 years later. His record of service
with that expedition was exemplary; he had a firsthand knowledge of much of the
country to be traversed, at least over the early stages of the route; he lacked neither
courage nor aptitude; and he possessed the ability to observe, describe, and record
in detail the experiences and observations of the expedition.</p>
<p>Hiram Martin Chittenden, in the biographical notes appended to his book,
<i>The Yellowstone National Park</i>, has given us, very briefly, an impression of the man
and his background.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Doane was born in Illinois, May 29, 1840, and died in Bozeman,
Montana, May 5, 1892. At the age of five he went with his parents, in wake of an ox
team, to Oregon. In 1849 his family went to California at the outbreak of the gold excitement.
He remained there ten years, in the meanwhile working his way through school.
In 1862 he entered the Union service, went East with the California Hundred, and
then joined a Massachusetts cavalry regiment. He was mustered out in 1865 as a First
Lieutenant. He joined the Carpetbaggers and is said to have become the Mayor of
Yazoo City, Mississippi. He was appointed Second Lieutenant in the Regular Army in
1868, and continued in the service until his death, attaining the rank of Captain.</p>
<p>Doane&rsquo;s whole career was actuated by a love of adventure. He had at various times
planned a voyage to the Polar regions, or an expedition of discovery into Africa. But
fate assigned him a middle ground, and he became prominently connected with the
discovery of the upper Yellowstone country. His part in the Expedition of 1870 is
second to none. He made the first official report (to the War Department) upon the
wonders of the Yellowstone, and his fine descriptions have never been surpassed by any
subsequent writer. Although suffering intense physical torture (from a felon on his
thumb, finally lanced by Mr. Langford) during the greater portion of the trip, it
did not extinguish in him the truly poetic ardor with which those strange phenomena
seem to have inspired him. Dr. Hayden (Ferdinand V. Hayden, United States Geologist,
Department of the Interior, 1871) says of this report: &ldquo;I venture to state, as my opinion,
that for graphic description and thrilling interest it has not been surpassed by any
official report made to our government since the times of Lewis and Clark.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doane&rsquo;s record, unpublished, of his heroic attempt to lead his party through the
wilderness of the Yellowstone, southward through Jackson Hole, and down the
&ldquo;Mad River&rdquo; to the Columbia is no less graphic in its vividness, no less thrilling
in its expression of the hazards and the wild beauty of the land. It is marked by
his absolute determination, no matter what the odds, to carry out his orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The Lieutenant, as his journal records, had previous notice that the expedition
was to be ordered, and partial preparation had been made before the orders were
received at Fort Ellis, near the present city of Bozeman, Montana. Ration boxes
were prepared and a boat was built, possibly the first such &ldquo;prefabricated&rdquo; craft
ever constructed. It was a double-ender, 22 feet long, 46 inches in the beam, 26
inches deep, and curved strongly fore and aft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was built entirely of inch plank, and put together with screws, then taken apart
again and the lumber lashed in two equal bundles, like the side bars of a litter. The
whole forming an easy load for two pack mules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For shelter the party carried an &ldquo;Indian Lodge,&rdquo; constructed of army wagon
covers cut to the proper pattern and with a diameter of 14 feet. The shelter
weighed &ldquo;but thirty pounds and sheltered the entire party.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the evening of October 10th, all preparations were complete for an expedition
never attempted before in the winter time, and never accomplished since. The enlisted
force was of picked men selected for special qualifications. In addition to those
enumerated in the previous order, Private Morgan Osborn &ldquo;G&rdquo; Troop, the carpenter
who built the little boat, and John L. Ward of &ldquo;L&rdquo; Troop, a teamster and packer, were
taken along to bring back extra mules and the wagon from whatever point might be
selected enroute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 11, the expedition moved out from Fort Ellis and south-eastward
toward the valley of the Yellowstone, reached that stream the following day and
thence up that &ldquo;wild and winding&rdquo; river toward the &ldquo;Mammoth Springs.&rdquo; The
wagon bearing supplies was drawn by 8 mules, 2 others carried the boat material,
each man was mounted except the teamster, an extra horse was led for him. All
went smoothly until the third day, when, not far from the northern boundary
of the Park, the</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... wagon came to grief, an unruly wheeler failed to pull at the right time, and the
heavy vehicle cramped and went over crushing a hind wheel and reducing the body to
something resembling kindling wood.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of this not unexpected mishap, the wagon was abandoned,
the load, comparatively undamaged, was made into packs, and after a 2-day
delay to rest the animals and arrange the loads, the party proceeded. In his
entry of October 16, Doane enumerates the equipment carried by his party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our outfit was an arctic one, omitting the stereotyped religious literature. We had
buffalo coats and moccasins, rubber boots and overshoes, heavy underclothing, and
plenty of robes and blankets. The detachment carried carbines only. Pistols are worthless
in the mountains. In fact they are worthless anywhere in the field. I carried a
12-pound Sharpes Buffalo Rifle, with globe sight on the stock and chambered
for long range cartridges. Our provisions did not include pemmican, Biltongue,
limejuice or any other of the orthodox food preparations, but consisted of plain
American rations, with some added commissaries, and an abundance of tea and
tobacco. Matches were packed on every animal, and each individual carried
several boxes constantly. Each man had a good hunting knife, not the crossed hilted
and murderous looking kind but a short one intended for cutting up game. Our cooking
apparatus included two fry pans, two Dutch ovens, four camp kettles, and some
mess pans. We had plenty of axes and each man carried a hatchet on his saddle. To
put together the boat required only a saw, a screw driver and a Gimlet, and we had a
sack of oakum, with which to calk the seams. Before starting, there had been no
solemnites, but each man&rsquo;s personal outfit was complete, arranged with a view to meet
all possible contingencies without delay. I had duplicate notebooks, one of which
Sergeant Server carried and from his, the only one left, I take my notes for this report.
Of instruments, I carried a prismatic compass, Aneroid Barometer, max and min
thermometers, and a long tape measure. None of these were provided by a generous
government, but all were purchased by myself&mdash;as usual in such cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>On October 17, the party lost the first of the pack animals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The morning air broke chilly and the air filled with frosty mist. One mule, a
queer slabsided one was down, paralyzed across the kidneys. Here was an emergency.
It was unable to stand alone when lifted to its feet, and would starve to death in a
few days if we left it. But one remedy was available and that was a severe one. We
heated kettles of water and scalded the animal along the spine. The first kettleful
brought him to his feet, without further assistance, and a few cups full from a second
restored his nerves enough so that he kicked vigorously at his kind physicians, and
refused further treatment. He was fearfully scalded but restored, and returned to Fort
Ellis next spring of his own volition, got entirely well and survived all of his comrades
of the pack train several years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A heavy snow storm began on the night of October 19, the party laid
over on October 20, and on October 21 made an early start for Mount Washburn,
camping on its upper slopes that night, to the great relief of the Lieutenant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was the highest point to be crossed (9,200 feet) and I was terribly uneasy
lest we should find it (the gap) blocked with snow as a depth of 30 feet is not unusual
in February. Beyond and at our feet now lay the Great Basin of the Yellowstone, with
its dark forests, its open spaces all wintry white, and its steam columns shooting
upward in every direction. It was like coming suddenly upon the confines of the unknown,
so differently did the snow landscape appear in the summertime. To us it was
an enchanted land, the portals of which had just been safely passed, and we struck the
downward trail full of enthusiasm, reached the open basin of Chrystal Spring Creek, the
lowest point in the Great Basin, and camped in snow two feet in depth. Distance 18 m.
Elevation 7250 feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 23, the party reached Yellowstone Lake, camping at its outlet.
En route that day Doane encountered a tremendous elk herd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking light loads and leaving a man with balance of the plunder to keep off
the bears as these animals are affected with a childish curiosity in relation to government
rations, I started in advance of the party on the Lake trail, and was riding along slowly
with my eyes shaded when my horse shied violently, with a snort, and stood trembling.
I jerked away the shade and saw that I had ridden close up to a herd of at least two
thousand elk. They had been lying in the snow, and had all sprung up together,
frightening my horse. In a minute the great herd was out of sight, crashing through
the forest, the old bulls screaming their strange fog-horn cry. It was a magnificent sight
as the bulls were in full growth of horns, and the calves all large enough to run
freely with the herd. No game animal has the majestic presence of a bull elk when he
is not frightened, and in herds they manuevre with a wonderful precision breaking by
file at a long swinging trot and coming into line right-left or front to gaze at some
object of apprehension with a celerity and absence of confusion truly remarkable. In
chasing them on horseback the first effect is to break them into a gallop, when they
move more slowly and soon tire. In deep snow, when the herd breaks the trail for
the horse to follow in, there is no difficulty in catching them.</p>
<p>I remember a chase in the Yellowstone Valley one winter day when two of us
killed seventeen elk in less than an hour. Two large wagon loads of meat. On this
occasion I did not shoot, as we had a long march to make and it would have caused
delay, but watched them &rsquo;til lost to view and rode on. This sign of abundant game was
exceedingly favorable and gave a confidence which nothing else could have inspired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the following 2 days the expedition remained in camp on the shore
of the lake, preparing the outfit for double transportation by land and water,
the pack animals and part of the men to follow the shoreline, the others to take
the boat across the lake. The little boat was assembled, the seams pitched,
and the &ldquo;Teeps&rdquo; erected for the first time, bough shelters having been used
previously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>On October 24, the men worked until late in the night making equipment
ready and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... retired to rest feeling all was well so far. During the night the stock stampeded
and ran in close to the camp fire. A strange, threatening voice was heard in the dense
forest nearby, a noise I had never heard before. A loud roaring was repeated. Applegate
gathered his belt and carbine and I the big rifle, and while the others quieted the
stock we moved out in the direction from which the sound came. It receded as we
advanced, and shortly, with a continued crashing the animal retreated out of hearing into
the timber. We soon came upon its trail and I sent back for a lantern. It was an
old bull moose. It had pawed up quite a space and barked a couple of young trees
with its horns thus producing the crashing sound we had first noticed. In accounts of
moose hunting, read previously, I had never seen it stated that a moose gave any call
whatever. These in the Park have voices, unquestionably, and use them with the utmost
freedom. Toward morning we were again roused by a flock of swans circling over us
with their wild and splendid notes, harmonized to a glorious symphony. In the morning
I shot and wounded a large wolverine but did not stop him, and Starr, while
prowling along the river bank below camp, shot a goose and found a small plank
canoe in which he proceeded to paddle out into the lake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doane&rsquo;s description of the moonlight night which followed is a classic
example of his ability to portray, in words, a picture of the wilderness he loved
so well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That evening, the moon was in full and rising high above the lake and mountain,
its soft light bathed the splendid landscape in floods of silver. The mighty ranges of
the great divide were sharply outlined in cold, gleaming white. Below their ragged
summits dark green forest masses filled the spaces to the margin of the water. At
intervals, steam jets played along the shore and the deep valley of the Upper Yellowstone
reached the farthest limit of vision in the foreground. On the left front appeared
a group of ghastly hills of chalky lustre by the banks of Pelican Creek, and beyond there
a winding valley constantly rising as it receded with glittering channels, from thermal
springs threading its long, green slopes. On the right front loomed up the yellow flank
of Mount Sheridan, seemingly ready to burst forth with sulphurous flames; and flooding
the space between lay the glorious lake with its rippling moonlit waters, its long sand
beaches and deeply indented shores, its rocky islands of splendid coloring, its cliffs and
inlets, and its still lagoons. A picture indescribable, unequalled and alone. From the
distant marshes on the newborn Yellowstone came the sound of fluttering cries of restless
waterfowl. From the echoing forest beyond, the mountain lions screaming and
moaning at intervals while we put the finishing touches on our little vessel. Starr and
Applegate, both expert boatmen, paddled the little canoe far out on the sparkling
waters and sang Crow Indian war songs, as the work went on. The horses and mules
having stuffed themselves with luxuriant mountain grasses, came up and stood meditatively
with their noses over the camp fires in thorough contentment. It was a night and
a scene to be remembered&mdash;a touch of nature vibrating into infinity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this entry also, seated by the campfire in a wonderfully expansive
mood of the utmost wellbeing, touched by the serene beauty of his surroundings,
Doane takes occasion to describe the other members of his party, the &ldquo;picked
men selected for special qualifications.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the men who composed my party, Sergeant Fred Server was a Philadelphian of
good family&mdash;a wild boy&mdash;who had settled down to a splendid daring soldier, an
expert horseman, a good shot, a man of perfect physique and iron constitution.</p>
<p>Private F. R. Applegate was a small, wiry Marylander, used to hard knocks,
thoroughly at home anywhere, full of expedients and know all about managing small
water craft.</p>
<p>Private Daniel Starr was a man of powerful voice and massive form, had served on
a war vessel, could turn his hand to any work. A man of infinite jest and humor, and
reckless beyond all conception. He was already a celebrity in Montana on account of
his uproarious hilarity, daring, and wild adventures. He ran the first boat on the
Yellowstone Lake in 1871, had piloted several parties through the Park, and was always
a volunteer in anything which promised a new field and a basis of new stories of the
most ludicrous and most exaggerated character.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Private William White was a quiet, solemn young fellow, useful in any service,
full of romantic ideas, sober, reserved. A man of fearless disposition.</p>
<p>Private John B. Warren was an Englishman, very set in ideas, an older man than
the others. A man of intelligence, a most indefatigable fisherman and an all round
utility man.</p>
<p>Private C. B. Davis was a born cook. He lived for his stomach alone and knew how
to prepare food for its pacification. He saw no value in anything that was not edible;
talked, thought, and dreamed of good things to eat, but came out strongly over a camp
fire. With a dishcloth in one hand and &ldquo;something dead&rdquo; in the other, he smiled
beamingly into the yawning interior of an open Dutch oven, and inhaled with unspeakable
delight the fragrant aroma of a steaming coffee pot. The above formed the
regular detail for the expedition.</p>
<p>The others, Private Morgan Osborn, a carpenter, was a careful, sober man, not
used to the mountains, faithful and honest and therefore useful.</p>
<p>Private John L. Ward was a hardy, vigorous man, good on a trail, in a boat, or
on a wheel mule, a packer and a woodsman.</p>
<p>They were all enthusiastic on the subject of the present expedition, and were
reliable, intrepid men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;little vessel&rdquo; was launched on October 26. No champagne christening
this, but she rode on an even keel and rose in fine style to the waves. Doane,
Starr, Applegate, and Ward voyaged out to Stevenson&rsquo;s Island and returned.
The next day the boat was carefully loaded, it carried everything except
the saddle outfits on the animals. A broken-down mule was left behind, and
with a mule harnessed to a tow line, and one man to steer the boat off shore, she
was so pulled along the beach for some 12 miles. At a rocky promontory,
the tow line was taken in and two men rowed the craft around the point.
Coming close to shore a wave struck the &ldquo;little vessel under the lee quarter,
and swamped her instantly.&rdquo; The water was shallow and everything was saved, but
camp was made at once, 15 miles from the point of launching.</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon and half the night was spent in keeping fires
going to dry out the baggage. The following morning it was discovered that
waves had knocked loose some of the calking on the bottom of the boat.
It was repaired with the remaining oakum and pitch. At this point, the
Lieutenant was &ldquo;very uneasy on account of the snow in sight on the Continental
Divide in front of us&rdquo;, so decided to leave Starr, Applegate, and Ward to
complete repairs to the boat, while he and the others, with all the &ldquo;property,
should push on, cross the divide, break a trail and return with mules and
horses to the lake shore to meet the party with the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doane and his group accordingly struck through the forest for several
miles on October 28, reached the lake shore again and followed it to the &ldquo;lower
end of the southwest arm where the foothills come on the shore. Skirted around
to the east side past the great group of silicate springs (probably the West
Thumb area) and camped at the foot of the Great Divide at the nearest point
opposite Heart Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning the land party remained near camp &ldquo;in hopes
that the men with the boat might come&rdquo;, and spent their time examining the springs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One crater cone still active stands in front of the main group, pouring a stream
of boiling water into the cold surrounding lake. It is here that anglers catch the trout
and cook them on the hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boat failing to appear, Doane and his men started up the slope to
the Divide in a &ldquo;heavy and blinding snow storm&rdquo; through a &ldquo;tangled forest.&rdquo; The
weather turned very cold, travel was difficult up the slopes in snow some 2
feet in depth. On the top of the ridge it was necessary to stop and build a
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
fire, the animals and men were &ldquo;loaded with snow and ice.&rdquo; The party reached
a &ldquo;hot spring basin&rdquo; a mile from Heart Lake long after dark, built a great
fire of seasoned pines, and spent most of the night drying out.</p>
<p>Doane was not at all satisfied with the route he had followed, and on the
following day, in clear weather, the party worked its way back to Yellowstone
Lake by a route which proved to be much shorter. The boat not having arrived,
a watchfire to serve as a beacon was built on a bluff on the lake shore. Doane&rsquo;s
entry in the journal for October 30 indicates his concern for the fate of the
voyageurs, Starr, Applegate, and Ward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That was their third day and I was consumed with anxiety. A cold, wintry blast was
driving down the lake in a direction at right angles to their course. The waves were
running high and on the opposite shore we could see the surf flying against the rocks,
covering them with glittering masses of ice. It was growing colder every minute, and
the night was intensely dark. A driving sleet began to fall. This was dangerous, as
it adhered to whatever it touched. Our apprehensions were almost beyond endurance. I
knew those men would start that night no matter what perils might be encountered. They
had twenty miles to come, in an egg shell boat which had never been tried in rough
water. Nothing could live in that icy flood half an hour, if cast overboard. The wind
and cold were both increasing constantly. Hour after hour passed. I followed the
beach a couple of miles, but finding no traces returned. The Sergeant went in the other
direction with like results. We were standing together on the shore despairing when
suddenly there was borne to us on the driving blast the sound of boisterous and double
jointed profanity. The voice was Starr&rsquo;s and we knew that the daring, invincible men
were safe and successful. We ran to meet them and helped them beach, and unload the
few articles that the boat contained. The oars were coated an inch thick and the boat
was half full of solid ice. When the three men came in front of the camp fire, they
were a sight to behold. Their hair and beards were frozen to their caps and overcoats
and they were sheeted with glistening ice from head to foot.</p>
<p>The boat had nearly filled three different times, but Applegate, who steered, threw
her bow to the waves and held her there while the others bailed her out. They found
that she would not bear the cross sea, so they kept her head to the wind, and forced
her to make leeway by pulling stronger on the opposite side and working the steering
oar to correspond. Thus they battled with the storm hour after hour until they had
drifted twenty miles and reached the other shore. We changed clothing with them and
after giving them a warm supper made them go to bed at once. The rest of the night
we put in drying their clothes, as they soundly slept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On October 31, the boat was cleared of ice by chopping it out with
axes, hot ashes were thrown in to dry her out inside, and &ldquo;slipper poles&rdquo;
were cut and fitted under her to serve as runners. Dragging side poles were also
attached to fend her off standing trees in passing. Two mules were hitched
to the boat in tandem to drag her, and although progress was slow because the
boat frequently became wedged between trees, and the deep snow made travel
very difficult for the mules, the Divide was crossed, and &ldquo;at 9 o&rsquo;clock at night
we left her on the Pacific slope of the Rocky Mountains, and went on with
the tired stock into camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On November 2, the extra men, Ward and Osborn, with their horses
and the 3 poorest mules, were started back to Fort Ellis, since they were
no longer needed. They were to pick up the mules and property left at different
points on the way, and after an arduous trip of several days they reached
Fort Ellis safely.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant and his reduced party now had 7 horses and 4 pack mules.
In camp at Heart Lake it was necessary to make extensive repairs to the boat,
the cold had &ldquo;shrunken the boards and opened all the seams.&rdquo; She was
finally in order and launched on Heart Lake on November 5. During this
layover the party feasted on baked porcupine, which &ldquo;resembled in taste young
pork with a faint flavor of pine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The party moved across and around Heart Lake on November 6, the boat
loaded with all the equipment, the horses and mules taken along the western
shore. It was necessary to drag the boat across the frozen lower section of the
lake for some 3 miles to the outlet, there the volume of the stream was so
small it would not float the craft, even unloaded, over the rocks of the stream
bed. For the next several days the &ldquo;little vessel,&rdquo; the men, and the animals
took a beating from the stream, the weather, and the terribly hard going.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>November 18th. Reached camp in the forenoon with all the calking melted out
of the seams and all the ice thawed out of the interior of the boat by the floods of
boiling water passed through in the river channel just above. Took her out of the water
and put her on the stocks to be dried out and thoroughly repaired. Her bottom was a
sight to behold. The green pine planks were literally shivered by pounding on the rocks.
The tough stripping of the seams, two inches or more in thickness, was torn away. Two
of the heaviest planks were worn through in the waist of the vessel, and three holes
were found in her sides. The stern was so bruised and stove that we had to hew out
a new one. We took out the seats, floor, and bulkheads, and this gave us lumber
enough to put on a new bottom. Mended the holes with tin and leather. Recalked her,
using candles and pitch mixed for the filling. Split young pines and put a heavy strip on
each seam and made her stronger than ever. This occupied the 19th which was a stormy
day, and the 20th, which was clear long enough to enable us to finish the boat.
When it is remembered that the wood had to be dry before the pitch would adhere,
and that we were obliged to keep a bed of coals under the boat constantly to effect
this on ground saturated with snow water and with the snow falling most of the time,
it can be realized that the labor was of the most fatiguing description. Half of the
party worked while the others cared for the animals and slept. Warren here came out
as an invaluable member of the party. He kept the camp full of trout and we fared
sumptuously. The stream from Shoshone Lake is the true Snake River and not the
one we are on. It is twice as large as this one, and should be mapped as the main
stream.</p>
<p>From this point we feel sure of plenty of water and will start with a partial load
in the boat. The strain on the animals has been terrible as they have had to double
trip the route almost constantly, which means three times the distance of actual progress.
We have had but little depth of snow, and this, while favorable in one sense, has
been detrimental in another, as it has allowed the game to run high on the mountains,
where we had not time to go. Had there been deeper snow, the water supply would
have been greater, the game would have been forced down to the valleys, and we would
not have been obliged to use the animals so constantly.</p>
<p>The problem was to get where the boat would carry the property and make distance
before the animals gave out. Also to get to settlements before rations were exhausted. I
knew we had the formidable &ldquo;Mad River Canyon&rdquo; of the old trappers between us and
human habitations. With plenty of large game in range, this would have caused no
uneasiness, but we were descending daily and leaving the game behind.</p>
<p>I spend many an hour over this problem studying all the chances, and endeavoring
to be prepared to act instantly in any possible emergency that might arise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The party resumed their travel on November 21, Doane, Starr, Applegate,
and White in the boat, Sergeant Server, Warren, and Davis with the animals. The
boat was headed down the now powerful stream, Applegate steering, Starr
astride the bow. Starr and White were armed with &ldquo;spike poles&rdquo; to push
her off rocks and guide her into deep channels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All was lovely. Starr had just begun to sing one of his favorite missionary hymns,
something about &ldquo;the Gospel ship is sailing now,&rdquo; when the river made a sudden
turn to the left with a boiling eddy, and the boat crashed head on against the overhanging
wall of rock, smashing all the lodge poles and compelling the boisterous singer to
turn a somersault backward to save himself from being instantly killed. The gallant
little craft bore the shock without bursting, and we went down stream (stern) foremost
a short distance onto a shelfing rock where an examination developed the fact that
nothing was damaged excepting twenty-two fine lodge poles.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>On November 23, nearing Jackson Lake, the valley of the Snake was
opening before the party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of otter were seen. These growled at us in passing from their holes in
the bank, not being accustomed to boats. We shot several.... An hour later we
ran out into Jackson&rsquo;s Lake, and passed the train just as a mule fell under a log across
the trail, struggled a moment, and died. Camped on the lake shore three miles from
the inlet.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following day both land and water parties progressed along the
western shore of Jackson Lake, the train finding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... terrible severe traveling, climbing over rocks and through tangled forests of pine,
aspen, and other varieties of timber.... Abandoned one horse.... We were too
near the mountains to get a full view, but above us rose the huge masses of glistening
granites too steep to retain much snow.... On the opposite shore are extensive Beaver
swamps, and great areas of marsh, now frozen.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The trout bite well, and we have a good supply. Ate our last flour today. Starr
cooked one of the fine otter killed the day before. The flesh was nice looking. It was
very fat and tempting. Baked in a Dutch oven and fragrant with proper dressing we
anticipated a feast, were helped bountifully and started with voracious appetites. The
first mouthful went down, but did not remain. It came up without a struggle. Only
Starr could hold it. The taste was delicately fishy, and not revolting at all, but the human
stomach is evidently not intended for use as an Otter trap. Like Banquo&rsquo;s ghost, &ldquo;It
will not down.&rdquo; We did not try Otter again.</p>
<p>November 25th. Laid over, giving the stock a rest and repaired boat. Warren
kept us well supplied with trout, which were in fine condition. In the afternoon my
attention was called to an object moving in the lake. It proved to be a deer, swimming
from the large island across to the opposite shore of the little bay. We had just
finished with the little boat, and catching up the big rifle, while the others pushed
off, Starr and Applegate rowed (me) out to intercept the deer. It saw us coming and
turning to the left reached the shore about three hundred yards away, where it stopped,
shivering on the bank. We stopped and let the boat settle to steadiness and I fired. The
deer was badly hit, and stood still. I fired again, and it fell into the water dead. It was
the first game we had killed for a long time and came in the nick of time. After dragging
it into the boat we found the two bullet holes about three inches apart and the
last one had gone through the heart of the animal.</p>
<p>When the gun was fired first, the whole party turned out along the shore thinking
than an avalanche was coming, and the noise of the second discharge had not ceased
when we landed with the game. It was an echo. We spent hours testing it afterward,
and surely nothing on earth can equal it. The report of the big rifle was followed by a
prolonged roar that seemed to eddy in the little bay in a vast volume of condensed
thunder, then charged up the great channel in a hollow, deep growl giving consecutive
reports which bounded from cliff to cliff and these re-echoed until far up the canyon
came back a rattle of musketry as on a skirmish line, mingled with mournful waves
of vibratory rumbling. These were succeeded by cracks and rustlings, and a moaning
sigh which slowly receded and died away far up along the heights. Time, one minute
and 25 seconds. We tried our voices together, and the result was deafening and overwhelming.
There were seven in the party, and we were answered back by a hoarse mob
of voices in accumulating thousands from the great gorge, and these, a moment after
retreating up the channel called to each other and back at us &rsquo;til the multiplied voices
mingled in a harsh jargon of weird and wild receding volume of sound, ending in a
long moaning sigh and a rustling as of falling leaves among the gleaming spires far
away above us.</p>
<p>I then tried Starr&rsquo;s tremendous voice alone, and had him call, &ldquo;Oh, Joe!&rdquo; with a
prolonged rising inflection on the first and an equally prolonged falling inflection on
the second word, repeating it at intervals of 30 seconds. Experience had taught us that
this call could be heard more distinctly and farther in the mountains than any other
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
practiced. The sound of his voice at the first call had not ceased when a hundred exact
repititions were reflected to the little bay. Then a rush of hoarse exclamations followed
up the gorge and the fusilade of calls on very rock and cliff answered, &ldquo;Oh, Joe!&rdquo; And
these sounds echoed and re-echoed a thousand times reaching higher and higher along
the mighty walls, &rsquo;til faint goblin whispers from the cold, icy shafts and the spectral
hollows answered back in clicking notes and hisses, but distinctly always the words,
&ldquo;Oh, Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A full band of music playing here would give such a concert as the world has
never heard. There is a weird, unearthly volume and distinctness to the echo here,
and a chasing afar off and returning of the sounds, unequalled and simply indescribable.
We named this inlet Spirit Bay.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The party continued along the lake shore, the usual mode of travel being
3 men in the boat, 4 with the animals on land. Doane&rsquo;s horse was abandoned
on November 26. All of the men were violently ill from the deer meat, the
Lieutenant diagnosing the sickness as &ldquo;cholera morbus.&rdquo; The party was forced
to lay over most of 2 days, but reached the outlet of the lake on November 30,
started down river, and camped 2 miles downstream from the Buffalo Fork on
that date, the boat having made about 30 miles that day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>December 1st. Moved on down the river. Sergeant and myself still very weak.
Camped opposite Gros Ventre Butte, which is in the middle of the valley, and in
front of Mount Hayden (earlier name for the Grand Teton) and its mighty canyon.
(From this description this camp appears to have been opposite Blacktail Butte, in
the vicinity of the present location of Moose.) During the day Warren and White
followed a herd of Elk &rsquo;til dark, but did not get one. Light snow on the ground.
Weather warm. At noon 65 degrees. Distance 12 m.</p>
<p>The boat now carries all the property as the animals can carry no more. The river
is a fine broad stream but the current is that of a mountain torrent and the channel
divides so often that we counted over one hundred islands today. Occasionally therefore,
we came to shoal water by getting in the wrong shute and had to lift her over. The
bed of the stream is entirely of coarse gravel and boulders, mostly of granite, and the
banks are low. Fishing good, but fresh fish is too thin a diet to subsist on alone.
We have now no coffee, sugar, tea, bacon, and worst of all, no tobacco. Nothing but
a few beans left. The game is scarce and shy. I cannot hunt and keep the observations
at the same time. The boat can now go faster than the stock, but we cannot separate,
with &ldquo;Mad River Canyon&rdquo; in front of us.</p>
<p>A glorious night, moon in the full, but empty stomachs. We are now far enough
away from the lakes to be clear of the clouds of vapor and local snow storms. Our
camp is about at a central point with reference to obtaining a view of the Tetons, and
at a distance of fifteen miles from the nearest part of the range. (Distance actually
about 7 miles, Doane&rsquo;s estimate inaccurate.) The moonlight view was one of unspeakable
grandeur. There are twenty-two summits in the line, all of them mighty mountains,
with the gleaming spire of Mount Hayden rising in a pinnacle above all. The whole
range is of naked rock in vast glittering masses, mostly coarse granites, but with some
carboniferous and metamorphose rocks, the splendid colorings of these sheeted as they
were with ice, contrasted finely with the snowy masses in all places where the snow
would lie, and with the sombre depths of the great avalanche channels and mighty
canyons. Of the latter the grandest is the Teton (Cascade Canyon) which half surrounds
Mount Hayden, is four thousand feet deep, where it opens out into the valley in front
of us, has a splendid torrent of roaring cascades in its channel and a baby glacier still
at its head. The wide valley in front, seamed with rocky channels and heaped with
moraines, is a grim, ruinous landscape. There are no foothills to the Tetons. They rise
suddenly in rugged majesty from the rock strewn plain. Masses of heavy forests appear
on the glacial debris and in parks behind the curves of the lower slopes, but the general
field of vision is glittering, glaciated rock. The soft light floods the great expanse of the
valley, the winding silvery river and the resplendent, deeply carved mountain walls. The
vast masses of Neve on the upper ledges from their lofty resting places shine coldly
down, and stray masses of clouds, white and fleecy, cast deep shadows over land and
terrace, forest and stream. And later on when the moon had gone down in exaggerated
volume behind the glorified spire of the Grand Teton (Doane must have used the
names Mount Hayden and Grand Teton interchangeably) the stars succeeded with their
myriad sparkling lights, and these blazed up in setting on the sharpcut edges of the
great, serrated wall like Indian signal fires in successive spectral flashes, rising and
dying out by hundreds as the hours passed on. On the wide continent of North America
there is no mountain group to compare in scenic splendor with the Great Tetons. There
was not a pound of food in camp. We ate the last beans for supper, before going out
to make notes on the Teton view.</p>

<p>The weakened party again laid over on the following day. They hunted
carefully but to no avail, since the horses were too weak to carry the riders
far afield from the camp, and the game was well up in the hills to the east.
Warren, that &ldquo;most indefatigable fisherman,&rdquo; caught 16 magnificent trout, all
of which were eaten for supper. Warren&rsquo;s horse was shot for food, since it
was the weakest and poorest of the lot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He had not a particle of fat on his carcass, and we had no salt or other seasoning.
Drew the powder from a package of cartridges and used it. We had been using the same
old coffee and tea grounds for two weeks and the decoctions derived therefrom had no
power in them, no momentum. For tobacco we had smoked larb, red willow, and rosebush
bark. All these gave a mockery and a delusion to our ceaseless cravings. We
chewed pine gum continually, which helped a little. We boned a quarter of the
old horse, and boiled the meat nearly all night, cracking the bones as well, and endeavoring
to extract a show of grease therefrom out of which to upholster a delicious
and winsome gravy. The meat cooked to a watery, spongy, texture, but the gravy sauce
was a dead failure. Horse meat may be very fine eating when smothered with French
sauces, but the worn out U. S. Cavalry plug was never intended for food. The flesh
tastes exactly as the perspiration of the animal smells. It is in addition tough and
coarse grained. We ate it ravenously, stopping to rest occasionally our weary jaws. It
went down and stayed, but did not taste good. Weather turned colder toward morning.
River running ice in cakes which screamed and crashed continually through the night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the next several days the party continued without serious mishap,
other than damage to the boat on two occasions when she crashed into submerged
boulders. Warren continued to take trout successfully, the fish and horsemeat
making up the sketchy bill of fare. On December 7, moving through the open
country of the southern part of Jackson Hole, Sergeant Server and Davis,
while hunting, found the cabin of a trapper, John Pierce. The old man was
greatly surprised to see anyone with animals in the upper Snake River Basin
at that time of the year, gave the men a substantial meal and some salt,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... which improved our regal fare by somewhat smothering the sour perspiration taste
of the old horse. He also sent word to me about the settlement below &ldquo;Mad River Canyon.&rdquo;
River too shallow for fishing, but we had salt on our horse for supper.</p>
<p>December 8th. The old trapper came to our camp before we started, bringing on
his shoulder a quarter of fat elk, also a little flour. He was a gigantic, rawboned, and
grisled old volunteer soldier. We gave him in return some clothing of which he was in
need and a belt full of cartridges, as he had a big rifle with the same sized chamber as
mine. While talking with him, Starr and Davis were busy and soon we had a meal.
The elk meat all went, the balance of the flour was reserved for gravies.</p>
<p>The old trapper gave me explicit and correct information about the settlements
below. He was trapping for fine furs only, mink, martin, fisher, and otter. Said it would
not pay to go after beaver unless one had pack animals and these could not winter in the
valley.</p>
<p>He told me that he had not believed the Sergeant&rsquo;s story about the boat at first,
and throughout his visit was evidently completely puzzled as to what motives could
have induced us to attempt such a trip in such a way and at such a season. I sent
him home on horseback with Sergeant Server, who told me after returning that he
had been given another &ldquo;Holy meal.&rdquo; Meantime we worked on down the river with renewed
strength among rocks and tortuous channels. Worked until after dark and
camped at the head of &ldquo;Mad River Canyon.&rdquo; 15 miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The voyage down the Grand
Canyon of the Snake, &ldquo;Mad River
Canyon,&rdquo; was a series of nightmares.
Steadily deepening and narrowing,
the canyon walls closing in
with oppressive gloom, the river
became almost completely unnavigable.
It was necessary to handline
the boat down boiling rapids, drag
her over the ice of frozen pools,
portage the equipment, in this manner
advancing 6 to 7 miles a day.
Doane writes that it was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...very cold in the shaded chasm.
Otter, fat and sleek, played around
us on the ice and snarled at us
from holes in the wall, all day
long, safe from molestation in
their fishy unpalatableness. We
had no time to shoot for sport,
nor transportation for pelts, and
no desire for any game not edible.
All day and as late at night as
we could see to labor, we toiled
to make six miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" />
<p class="pcap">The upper end of the Grand Canyon of the
Snake, Doane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mad River Canyon.&rdquo; The
wicked white water of the Snake brought
disaster to the Expedition on December 12,
1876, near the lower end of the gorge, when
&ldquo;all of a sudden the boat touched the icy
margin, turned under it, and the next instant
was dancing end over end in the swift, bold
current.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>On December 11, Doane concluded to split his party.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No food left but a handful of flour. Shot White&rsquo;s horse, and feasted. It was now
evident that we were not going to run the canyon with the boat, but must tug away
slowly. We were about 42 miles from the first settlement, if our information was correct,
but the canyon, if very crooked as it had been so far, might double that distance.
I desired to get the boat through if we had to risk everything in order to do so. This
canyon was the terrible obstacle and we were more than half way through it. Apparently
the worst had been gone through with. All the men agreed to this with enthusiasm.
We gathered together all the money in the possession of the party, and
arranged for Sergeant Server, the most active and youngest of the party, and Warren,
who could be of no assistance to those remaining, as his stomach had begun to give
way, to go on next day with the two horses and one mule remaining and bring us back
rations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Server and Warren loaded up as planned the following day, leaving
the Lieutenant and the other 4 men to continue with the boat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The river was becoming better, the ice foot more uniform and the channel free
from frozen pools when all of a sudden the boat touched the icy margin, turned under
it, and the next instant was dancing end over end in the swift, bold current. All of
the horse meat, all the property, arms, instruments and note books were in the roaring
stream. A few hundred yards below there was a narrow place where the ice foot
almost touched the middle of the river. We ran thither and caught whatever floated.
The clothing bags, valise, bedding, bundles, and the lodge were saved. All else,
excepting one hind quarter of the old horse, went to the bottom and was seen no more.
All the rubber boots were gone excepting mine. The warm clothing all floated and
was saved. We dragged in the boat by the tow line and pulled her out of the water
and far up on a ledge of rock. 6 miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>After this mishap, the Sergeant and Warren, who had been traveling along
the river bank, keeping in contact with the boat party, were sent at once
on their way, while Doane and his men dried out and rested. The boatmen
fought their way down the river for the next two days, but on December
14 the boat was hauled high on the bank in an apparently secure place. The
last of the horse meat had been eaten for breakfast, no food was left.</p>
<p>The following morning the bedding was stored away in rolls with
the valise, high up among the rocks, and Doane&rsquo;s party started,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... unarmed, without food, and in an unknown wilderness to find settlements
(previously described by the trapper, Pierce) seven miles up on a stream which we had
no positive assurance of being able to recognize when we came to its mouth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That day the men waded the Salt River (near the present site of Alpine)
having spent 7 days in the gloomy depths of the &ldquo;Mad River Canyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On December 16, they were moving at the break of day in bitterly cold
weather, and about noon reached an ice bound creek which showed signs of
placer washings. They assumed, correctly as it developed, that the settlements
described by Pierce were on this tributary stream. Due to crusted snow they could
make only about 1 mile an hour, but upon reaching the creek they walked
on the ice, and were thus able to make better progress. Some distance upstream
the creek forked, and the men took the left hand branch. By dark they had
determined they were in error. They sheltered by a huge fire that night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We slept a little but only to dream of bountifully set tables loaded with viands, all
of which were abounding in fats and oils. What conservation there was turned
entirely to matters pertaining to food. Davis talked incessantly on such subjects,
giving all the minutest details of preparing roast, gravies, meat pies, suet puddings,
pork preparations, oil dressings, cream custards, and so on, until Starr finally choked
him off with the Otter experience. None of us felt the pangs of hunger physically.
Our stomachs were cold and numb. We suffered less than for two days before, but there
was a mental appetite, more active than ever. It was an agony to sleep. All the party
evidenced the same mental conditions excepting Davis who was hungry clear through,
sleeping or waking. One feeling we had in common. It can be found explained in
Eugene Sue&rsquo;s description of the Wandering Jew. We were impatient of rest, and all
felt a constant impulse to &ldquo;go on, go on,&rdquo; continually. The men did not seem to court
slumber, and Starr had an inexhaustible fund of his most mirth provoking stories which
he never tired of telling. We listened, laughed, and sang. Afterward we tried to catch
a couple of Beaver which splashed within a few feet of us all night long. Had not a
firearm in the party and here was the fattest of good meat almost under our hands,
enough to have fed us for two days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the first gray streaks of dawn they were again on their way, working
over the ridge to the other fork of the creek which they reached a few hours
later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A couple of miles farther on we stopped to build a fire and warm ourselves.
Davis showed signs of undue restlessness. We had to call him back from climbing the
hillsides several times. While we were gathering wood for the fire, I found a section
of sawed off timber blocks such as they use for the bottoms of flumes. It had been
recently cut on one side with an axe. This satisfied me without farther evidence that
the mines above were not old placers, now deserted. The men were not so sanguine,
but were cheerful, and we soon moved on again. In a couple of hours we came to an
old flume. Shortly after, Applegate declared he smelled the smoke of burning pine.
In half an hour more we reached a miner&rsquo;s cabin and were safe. We arrived at 3 pm.
having been 80 hours without food in a temperature from 10 degrees to 40 degrees
below zero, and after previously enduring privations as before detailed. Two old miners
occupied the cabin and they were both at home, having returned from a little town above
with a fresh stock of provisions. They at once produced some dry bread and made
some weak tea, knowing well what to do. We had to force those things down. None
of us felt hungry for anything but grease. About this time, to our unspeakable delight,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
Sergeant Server and Warren also arrived. They had passed the mouth of the creek on
the 13th and gone below to the next stream which they had followed up fourteen miles
without finding anything, and returning to meet us had found our trail and followed it,
knowing that we had nothing to eat, while they had two horses and a mule with them.
Mr. Bailey and his partner now gave us a bountiful supper of hot rolls, roast beef,
and other substantial fare, and we all ate heartily in spite of our previous resolutions
not to do so. Cold, dry bread had no charms, but hot and fatty food roused our
stomachs to a realization that the season of famine was over. The change affected us
severely. I had an attack of inflammation of the stomach which lasted several hours.
All of the men suffered more or less, excepting Starr who seemed to be unaffected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day the party moved upstream to the little town, Keenan City,
which consisted of a store, saloon, post office, blacksmith shop, stable, and
&ldquo;a lot of miners&rsquo; cabins.&rdquo; Doane found that they had followed McCoy Creek,
and that the settlements were collectively known as the Caribou mining district.
The Lieutenant records that his weight was down to 126 from a normal 190,
and the others were similarly reduced.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;jerky stage line&rdquo; operated between Keenan City and the Eagle Rock
Bridge on the Snake above Fort Hall, and Lieutenant Doane accordingly prepared
the following telegram to be forwarded by the Post Adjutant at Fort Hall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commanding Officer, Fort Ellis, Montana. Arrived here yesterday. All well. Write
today. Send mail to Fort Hall. (Signed) Doane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the Lieutenant&rsquo;s plan at this time to construct small sleds for the rations
and bedding rolls, these to be drawn by the 2 horses and the mule left to the
expedition, and thus proceed downriver to Fort Hall. All was in readiness by
December 23, and the party set out, proceeding some 20 miles through Christmas
Day. While in camp on the evening of December 26, voices were heard in the
river bottom nearby, where a party of troops had just gone into camp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Lieutenant Joseph Hall, 14th Infantry, with four men and a good little
pack train. I shall never forget the puzzled expression on the face of this officer when
he first met me. He conversed in monosyllables for a couple of minutes and then told
us that he had been sent to arrest a party of deserters, half a dozen in number, which
had been advertised for in the Montana papers, as having left Fort Ellis and were
supposed to have gone through the Park and down Snake River. Thirty dollars each
for apprehension and capture. The stage driver had read the papers it seems and
denounced us to the Post Commander at Fort Hall. We first had a hearty laugh over the
joke and he then placed himself and party at my disposal. We sat by the fire and
talked nearly all night. (He was Post Adjutant at Fort Hall, and evidently knew
something more than he felt at liberty to tell me, but he denounced Major Jas. S.
Brisbin, 2d Cavalry, my Post Commander, in unmeasured terms, and told me that I
was being made a victim of infamous treachery. This was a revelation but not a
surprise.)<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next day Sergeant Server and 4 men were sent with fresh animals to recover
the boat and the bedding cached upriver. They returned the day following, reporting
that it was only &ldquo;fifteen miles by the trail on the other side of the river.&rdquo; They
brought with them the equipment but not the boat, which had been crushed to
splinters by an ice jam which had piled up in masses 20 feet high.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was a bitter disappointment as they found the river open all the way down,
and we so found it afterwards below. Here was another strange occurrence. In exploring
as in hunting there is an element of chance which cannot be provided against.
No foresight will avail, no calculations will detect, no energy will overcome. Caution
might prevent, but with caution no results will be obtained. Risks must be taken, and
there is such an element in human affairs as fortune, good or bad. I decided at once
to make all possible speed to Fort Hall, there refit and returning bring lumber to rebuild
the boat on the ground where it had been lost, and continue to Eagle Rock
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
Bridge on the Snake River, previously going back far enough beyond Jackson&rsquo;s Lake to
take a renewal of the system of triangulation and notes, lost in the river when the
boat capsized. At Eagle Rock Bridge it would be necessary to rebuild the boat again
in a different form and much larger, to run the heavy rapids of the lower rivers to
Astoria, at the mouth of the great Columbia. The hardships and greater dangers we
had already passed. With food for one day more we could have made the passage of
&ldquo;Mad River Canyon&rdquo; despite the loss of all our weapons, instruments, and tools. We
had run all the rapids but two, and these were easier than many others safely passed
above. All the party enthusiastically endorsed this plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lieutenant Doane was indeed a persevering and meticulously thorough individual,
so much so that he not only planned to return to run the river from the
point where he had been obliged to leave off, but to retrace his route to a point
above Jackson Lake in order to bring his notes to completion. It is difficult to
follow his thinking when he indicates his intention of running the Columbia
to Astoria, since his orders were to &ldquo;make exploration of Snake River from
Yellowstone Lake <i>to</i> Columbia River.&rdquo; His statement that the &ldquo;greater dangers&rdquo;
had already been passed seems incompatible with the Hell&rsquo;s Canyon of the Snake
below, a section of the river about which Doane must have had some knowledge.
Here indeed were &ldquo;risks to be taken&rdquo; with &ldquo;bad fortune&rdquo; certain, quite probably
occurring beyond a point of no return.</p>
<p>The party continued on December 29 toward Fort Hall, with Doane&rsquo;s journal
describing in detail the route followed, the nature of the terrain, and the course
of the river. They arrived at Fort Hall on January 4, having been met about
half way between Fort Hall and the Eagle Rock Bridge by ambulances sent
to bring them.</p>
<p>Captain Bainbridge, Commanding Officer at Fort Hall,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... received us with the greatest kindness, and everything possible was done for the
comfort of myself and party, by all at the post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There followed an exchange of communications between the Lieutenant and
the Commanding Officer at Fort Ellis, Major Brisbin, with no reference therein
to the charge of desertion. In the meantime, Doane records,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We put in time at Fort Hall preparing to get together materials for another boat,
intending to renew the expedition from &ldquo;Mad River Canyon.&rdquo; Meantime I had made
one of my Centenial Tents for Captain Bainbridge. While so engaged on the 8th of
January, the following telegram came.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">Dated Chicago, Ill. January 6, 1877</span>
<span class="lr">Received at Fort Hall, Idaho, January 8, 1877</span></p>
<p>To Commanding Officer, Fort Hall, Idaho</p>
<p>You will direct Lieut. Doane, Second Cavalry, with his escort to rejoin his proper
station Fort Ellis, as soon as practicable. Acknowledge receipt.</p>
<p><span class="lr">R. C. Drum</span>
<span class="lr">A. A. G.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That Doane was very bitter at this turn of events is indicated by subsequent
entries in his journal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was the result. I simply note here an extract from Sergeant Server&rsquo;s journal.
The only one left us when the boat capsized. &ldquo;Lt. Doane was very mad in consequence
of our having to return, and so were all the men, but we tried to make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over a year afterward I received the key to this mystery. And here it is. It
will be observed that there is some little truth in it, and much that is false. And bear
in mind that my letter and telegram from Keenan City were received on the 28th December,
and that I had not yet been heard from at Eagle Rock or Fort Hall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accordingly Doane and 4 men were returned to Fort Ellis by stage,
arriving on January 20. Sergeant Server and White, leaving Fort Hall on January
12, &ldquo;with the expedition&rsquo;s baggage and the extra horse&rdquo; arrived at Fort Ellis
on February 2, bringing to a close the final stage of the exploration.</p>
<p>One last entry in Lieutenant Doane&rsquo;s journal is worthy of mention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In December, 1878, I was told by my commanding officer, Major Jas. S. Brisbin,
that he had disapproved of the expedition from the beginning, and had worked to
have me ordered back because I had not applied for the detail through him. I make no
comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A careful study of the journal reveals statements that can be questioned
in the light of later knowledge. The mellifluous descriptions, the references
to &ldquo;hundreds of otter,&rdquo; and some other observations, together with the general
tone of the document, may to some readers appear overdrawn. It must be borne
in mind, however, that the journal was obviously written some time after Doane&rsquo;s
return to Fort Ellis, and from Server&rsquo;s notes, since the Lieutenant&rsquo;s records had
been lost when the boat capsized on December 12. Server&rsquo;s notes were probably
sketchy at best, much of the writing then was done from memory. That the
account is colored by some imagination and a desire to make a &ldquo;good yarn&rdquo;
of it is probably true, but forgivable, particularly when one considers the usual
tenor adopted by writers of that day.</p>
<p>However critical the reader&rsquo;s opinion may be, it cannot be denied that
here is an odyssey which defies comparison with any other record of winter exploration
of the region. It was fortunate, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Doane&rsquo;s
expedition did not continue. That his party could have survived ultimate disaster
in the Hell&rsquo;s Canyon of the Snake is incomprehensible. That Doane, stubborn
and fearless as he was, would have been turned back by any terrors the river
threw at him is equally so. Doane was an explorer in every sense of the word,
he was determined to overcome all obstacles, he was, in truth, a man &ldquo;to ride
the river with.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="smaller">By <span class="sc">Fritiof Fryxell</span></span></h2>
<p>Jackson Hole, widely reputed to have been the favored retreat and rendezvous
of cattle thieves, outlaws, and &ldquo;bad men&rdquo; in the early days, has long enjoyed the
glamour which goes with a dark and sinful past, and this reputation has by
no means been lost sight of by those who have been active in advertising the
assets of this fascinating region. But when the dispassionate historian critically
investigates the basis for this reputation he is surprised to find so little evidence
wherewith to justify it, or to indicate that pioneer times in Jackson Hole were
much different from those in other nearby frontier communities; and he is
forced to conclude that the notoriety of Jackson Hole, like the rumor of Mark
Twain&rsquo;s death, has been slightly exaggerated. Doubtless the geographic features
of the valley have encouraged the popular belief, for from the standpoint of
isolation and inaccessibility Jackson Hole might well have been a paradise for
the fugitive and lawless.</p>
<p>But, in fairness to the old idea, which one is reluctant to abandon, it must
be conceded that among the authentic narratives, that have come down to us
from pioneer times, there are 1 or 2 which hold their own with the choicest
that wild west fiction has dared to offer, and these bolster up to some extent the
rather faltering case for Jackson Hole&rsquo;s former exceptional badness. Such a
narrative is the story of Deadman&rsquo;s Bar.</p>
<p>There are few residents of the Jackson Hole country who have not heard
of the Deadman&rsquo;s Bar affair, a triple killing which took place in the summer
of 1886 along the Snake River and which gave this section of the river the name
of Deadman&rsquo;s Bar. It is the most grim narrative and the most celebrated in the
pioneer history of the valley, and its details are sufficiently bloody to satisfy
the most sanguinary tourist, thirsty for western thrills.</p>

<h3>EMILE WOLFF&rsquo;S NARRATIVE</h3>
<p>When Colonel Ericsson, Mr. Owen, and the writer visited Emile Wolff
on August 9, 1928, we found him stricken with the infirmities of old age and
confined to what proved to be his deathbed. Nevertheless his senses were alert
and his memory concerning the period in question keen and accurate. The account
he gave checked in detail with one he had given Colonel Ericsson a year earlier,
and his recollection of names and dates agreed in most cases with evidence obtained
later from other sources. In his enfeebled condition, however, Wolff was so
weakened by the telling of his story that the interview had perforce to be cut short
and certain questions left unanswered. A few questions Wolff declined to answer
with the statement that there were features of the affair he would like to forget
if he could, and there were others he had never told anyone and never would.
What he had told other men, he said, he would tell us.</p>
<p>Concerning himself Mr. Wolff stated that he was 76 years old and a German
by blood and birth, having been born in 1854 in Luxembourg. He received an education
along medical lines in the old country. When still a very young man, only 16, he
emigrated to America, where he served for some years in the United States Army
in the Far West, part of the time as a volunteer doctor. His first visit to the Jackson
Hole region was in 1872 when he came to Teton Basin (Pierre&rsquo;s Hole) for a
brief period. In 1878 while serving under Lieutenant Hall, he came into Jackson
Hole, his detachment being sent to carry food to Lieutenant Doane&rsquo;s outfit,
which had lost its supplies in the Snake River while engaged in a geological
survey of the Jackson Hole area<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>In 1886, Wolff stated, he came to the region to stay, settling first in Teton
Basin. It was in this year that the Deadman&rsquo;s Bar incident took place. The account
of this affair which follows is pieced together from the facts given by Wolff; no
information gained from other sources has been introduced, and there have been
no changes made in the story other than the rearrangement of its details into
historical order. The account as set forth has been verified by both Colonel Ericsson
and Mr. Owen, who were present at its telling.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1886 four strangers came into Jackson Hole to take up placer
mining along Snake River, whose gravels were reputed to be rich in gold. The new
outfit had been organized in Montana, and originally had consisted of three
partners, Henry Welter, (T. H.) Tiggerman, and (August) Kellenberger&mdash;&ldquo;the
Germans&rdquo; as they came to be called. Henry Welter, who had previously been
a brewer in Montana, proved to be an old friend and schoolmate of Emil Wolff&rsquo;s
from Luxembourg. Tiggerman was a gigantic fellow who had served on the
King&rsquo;s Guard in Germany, he seemed to be something of a leader in the project,
claiming&mdash;apparently on insecure grounds&mdash;that he knew where placer gold was
to be obtained. August Kellenberger, also a brewer by trade, was a small man
who had two fingers missing from his right hand. The trio of prospective miners
had added a fourth man to the outfit, one John Tonnar by name, also a German,
under promise of grub and a split in the cleanup.</p>
<p>The miners located near the center of Jackson Hole on the north bank
of the Snake River where that river flows west for a short distance. They erected
no cabins, according to Wolff, but lived in tents pitched in a clearing among
the trees on the bar, within a few hundred yards or so of the river. Occasional
visits to the few ranchers then in this portion of the Territory brought them a
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
few acquaintances. Once they ran out of grub and crossed Teton Pass to Wolff&rsquo;s
place to get supplies. Wolff recalled that they paid for their purchases with
a $20 gold piece. They wanted a saw, and Wolff directed them to a neighbor
who had one; this they borrowed, leaving $10 as security.</p>

<br />Deadman&rsquo;s Bar, at lower left, marks the location of &ldquo;the German&rsquo;s&rdquo; camp, where
they lived in tents pitched in a clearing among the trees.</p>
</div>
<p>On the occasion of this visit they spoke of building a raft to use in crossing
the Snake at their workings, and Wolff tried to dissuade them from the project,
assuring them that they did not appreciate how dangerous the Snake could be
when on the rise; but they laughed off his warnings with the statement that
they had built and handled rafts before, and knew their business.</p>
<p>Wolff learned little, until later, concerning the mutual relations of the 4
men on the bar, nor concerning what success, if any, they had in finding gold.</p>
<p>Late that summer when haying time was at hand in Teton Basin, Wolff
was surprised to see a man approaching his cabin on foot. &ldquo;Seeing any man, and
especially one afoot, was a rare sight in those days,&rdquo; commented Wolff. It proved
to be the miner, Tonnar, and he asked to be given work. Curious as to what was
up between Tonnar and his partners, Wolff quizzed him but received only the
rather unsatisfactory statement that Tonnar had left the 3 miners while they
were making plans to raft the Snake in order to fetch a supply of meat for the camp.</p>
<p>With hay ready for cutting, Wolff was glad to hire Tonnar for work in the
fields. For a month the two men slept together, and during this time Wolff noticed
that Tonnar invariably wore his gun or had it within reach, but while he suspected
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
that all was not right he made no further investigation. Wolff retained a mental
picture of Tonnar as being a small, dark-complexioned man of rather untrustworthy
appearance and manner.</p>
<p>Once Tonnar instructed Wolff to investigate a certain hiding place in the cabin,
and he would find some valuables which he asked him to take care of. Wolff
did so and claims that he found a silver watch and a purse containing $28.</p>
<p>Then one day late in August a sheriff and posse came to the cabin and asked
Wolff if he could furnish information concerning the whereabouts of the miner,
Jack Tonnar (at the time Tonnar was absent, working in the fields.) Briefly the
posse explained that Tonnar&rsquo;s 3 partners had been found dead, that Tonnar
was believed guilty of their murder, and that the posse was commissioned to
take him. Horrified to think that for a month he had sheltered and slept with
such a desperate character, Wolff could only reply, &ldquo;My God! Grab him while you
can!&rdquo; Tonnar was found on a haystack and captured before he could bring his
gun into play.</p>
<p>From the posse Wolff learned that a party boating from Yellowstone Park
down the Lewis and Snake Rivers, under the leadership of one Frye (Free), had
stopped at the workings of the miners but had found them unoccupied. Just below
the encampment, at the foot of a bluff where the Snake had cut into a gravel
bank, they had come upon 3 bodies lying in the edge of the water, weighted
down with stones. They had reported the gruesome find, and the arrest of Tonnar
on Wolff&rsquo;s place resulted.</p>
<p>Wolff, Dr. W. A. Hocker (a surgeon from Evanston), and a couple of Wolff&rsquo;s
neighbors from Teton Basin hurried to the scene of the killings, a place which
has ever since been known as Deadman&rsquo;s Bar. They readily identified the bodies,
Tiggerman by his size, and Kellenberger from the absence of two fingers on his
right hand. They found that Kellenberger had been shot twice in the back, that
Welter had an axe cut in the head, and that Tiggerman&rsquo;s head was crushed,
presumably also with an axe. Wolff gave it as their conclusion that the 3
men must have been killed while asleep; and that their bodies had been hauled
up onto the &ldquo;rim&rdquo; and rolled down the gravel bluff into the river, where they
had lodged in shallow water and subsequently been covered with rocks. Probably
the water had fallen, more fully exposing the bodies so that they had been discovered
by Frye&rsquo;s men.</p>
<p>Wolff and Hocker removed the heads of Welter and Tiggerman and cleaned
the skulls, preserving them as evidence. Wolff denied that they buried the bodies,
but claimed that they threw them back in the edge of the water and covered
them again with rocks.</p>
<p>Tonnar pleaded not guilty and was taken to Evanston, the county seat of Unita
County (which then embraced the westernmost strip of Wyoming Territory), and
here he was tried the following spring before Judge Samuel Corn. Wolff was
called to testify at the trial, mentioning, among other things, the incident of the
watch and the purse, both of which he was positive Tonnar had stolen from
his murdered partners.</p>
<p>To the general surprise of Wolff, Judge Corn, and others present at the trial,
Tonnar was acquitted by the jury, despite the certainty of his guilt. What subsequently
became of him is not clear. Wolff was questioned on this point, and
at first declined to speak, later, however, expressing the belief that Tonnar
probably went back to the old country for fear that friends of Welter, Tiggerman
and Kellenberger might take the law into their own hands since the jury had
failed to convict him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Concerning the question of motive for the killing, Wolff stated that he knew
Tonnar and the 3 men quarreled. The original partners planned to turn Tonnar
loose when his services were no longer needed in sluice digging, etc., minus
his share in the cleanup. To discourage his persisting with their outfit they had
beaten him up badly a few days prior to the murders; but instead of leaving
Tonnar had stayed at camp, nursing his bruises and plans for revenge, finally
carrying out the latter to the consummation already described. Wolff did not believe
that robbery was a factor of much importance in instigating the crime.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>From parties who heard the trial it appears that there were no eye witnesses
to the tragedy, save the defendant. Therefore the prosecution was compelled to
rely solely on circumstantial evidence. The theory of the attorneys for the defendant
was that the 3 deceased persons were prospectors, without funds, and that they
represented to the defendant that they had discovered a valuable mining claim
and induced him to put up considerable money to grubstake and furnish necessary
funds to work the claim; that soon after these men were on their way to the Jackson
Hole Country they began to pick quarrels with the defendant; that on the day
of the shooting one of the prospectors remained in camp with the defendant, and
the other 2 went away to do some prospecting; that the one who remained in
camp picked a quarrel with the defendant and the defendant was compelled to
kill him in self-defense. It was recalled that after the verdict was rendered the
defendant got out of town in a hurry, taking the first freight train; that Attorney
Blake was the principal trial attorney for the defendant, and that he afterwards
stated he never got a cent for saving the neck of the defendant, who had promised
to send him some money as soon as he could earn it, and that he had never heard
from him.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>Dr. Fryxell and Colonel Ericsson, immediately following their interview with
Mr. Wolff on August 9, 1928, investigated the site of &ldquo;Deadman&rsquo;s Bar.&rdquo; They
found unmistakable traces of the diggings, the camp, and the road constructed
42 years before by the 4 prospectors.</p>
<p>Dr. Fryxell&rsquo;s study of the site cleared up any uncertainty as to the exact
location of this historic spot, which was placed on the north side of the Snake
in the SW&frac14; of Sec. 23, T44N, R115W.</p>
<p>The sluice ditch of the miners, though overgrown with brush and partially
filled with gravel, was easily located. It tapped a beaver dam located just above
the bar, and followed along the base of the terrace, discharging into the Snake
about a half-mile from its source.</p>
<p>Numerous prospect pits were found on the bar. Some of them appeared more
recent than those dug by Tonnar and the other &ldquo;Germans,&rdquo; thus were probably
the work of later prospectors.</p>
<p>Dr. Fryxell states: &ldquo;All of the workings (1928) now observable speak
graphically of the expenditure of much hard labor from which returns were never
forthcoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement is significant, and is borne out by an old sign, crudely lettered,
which was reportedly found later in the vicinity:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Payin gold will never be found here</p>
<p class="t0">No matter how many men tries</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">THE AFFAIR AT CUNNINGHAM&rsquo;S RANCH<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></span>
<br /><span class="smaller">By <span class="sc">Roald Fryxell</span></span></h2>
<p>Close against the Idaho-Wyoming border, at the headwaters of the Snake
River, lies the high, mountain-girt valley of Jackson Hole. Fiercely beautiful in
setting and richly historic in background, Jackson Hole and the raw, jagged peaks
of the Teton mountains to the west have captured popular imagination as has no
other region in the Rockies. Jackson Hole has become a fabled outpost of the
vanished Western frontier, the legendary &ldquo;last stand of the outlaws.&rdquo; And of all
the stories which have given rise to that picture, perhaps none is more starkly simple
than one which has become known as <i>The Affair at Cunningham&rsquo;s Ranch</i>.</p>
<p>As in the case of other frontier communities, the story of the early settlers in
Jackson Hole is one of isolation and hardship. When winter closed in and cut off
the valley from the nearest settlements across the mountains, life was a struggle for
survival against the bitter cold and drifting snow. Occupied with the task of making
a home in the face of tremendous odds, the homesteaders were solid, law-abiding
citizens with little time for lawlessness, and less for violence. On the rare occasions
when gun-play broke out between men in the valley, it was of a nature that could
hardly appear heroic except through the romantic eyes of a novelist. In the harsh
light of reality, violence was brutal and ugly, and dispatched with a speed and
finality grimly typical of the frontier.</p>
<p>The Cunningham Ranch affair broke with a suddenness that shocked the
entire valley. It was as cold-blooded as it was simple. A posse came riding in from
Montana in the spring of 1893, and at a little cabin near Spread Creek two men
were cornered and shot for horse-stealing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Little news of the Spread Creek incident ever leaked out of the valley in
the early days, and when the first general flow of tourist travel into Jackson Hole
began nearly 40 years later, the affair at Cunningham&rsquo;s Ranch was still a widely
known but reticently guarded story. By then most of the old-timers who had
been members of the posse were dead, and those who were left still were not
interested in discussing the matter. And so the story of the killing relies almost
entirely on the memory and information of the one man who cared to talk about it,
Pierce Cunningham.</p>
<p>A quiet, weather-beaten little man, Pierce Cunningham came into Jackson Hole
with the first influx of settlers during the late 1880&rsquo;s and early 1890&rsquo;s. He homesteaded
in the valley, and there, on Flat Creek, he worked his ranch and married
and raised his family.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1892, while he was haying on Flat Creek, Cunningham was
approached by a neighbor named White who introduced 2 strangers, stating
that they wished to buy hay for a bunch of horses they had with them. One of the
men, named George Spenser, was about 30 and had come originally from Illinois;
the other was an Oregon boy named Mike Burnett, much younger than Spenser
but already rated a first-class cattleman after having punched cattle for several years
elsewhere in Wyoming. Cunningham sold them about 15 tons of hay and incidentally
arranged to let the men winter in his cabin near Spread Creek, about 25
miles to the north. Since Cunningham himself intended to remain at Flat Creek,
he also arranged for his partner, a burly Swede named Jackson, to stay with them.</p>
<p>Rumor began spreading during the winter that the 2 men on Cunningham&rsquo;s
place were fugitive horse thieves. Some of the rustlers&rsquo; horses, it was said, belonged
to a cattleman in Montana; a valley rancher had worked for him and recognized
some of the brands. Before the snow was gone Cunningham had taken it upon
himself to snowshoe to Spread Creek, investigate conditions, and warn Jackson to
be on guard. Once there his suspicions were confirmed. Cunningham spent several
days with the men, went with them to search for their horses, and recognized certain
stocks and changed brands that left no question in his mind as to their guilt. The
die was cast, and although he could readily have warned the men of their danger,
Cunningham returned home without doing so.</p>
<p>The next spring, however, he ordered Spenser and Burnett to leave, and they
did; but unfortunately for them, they returned to look for some horses on the very
day they should have been absent.</p>
<p>This was in April 1893. Across the mountains to the west a man from Montana
was organizing a posse in the little Idaho settlement of Driggs. Somehow, possibly
on a tip relayed from the Hole, he had got wind of the rustlers on Cunningham&rsquo;s
place and was coming to get them. One of the valley homesteaders saw the posse
leader there with a group of 15 men on saddle horses, and a few days later they
came riding over the pass from Teton Basin into Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>In the valley of ... the leader completed organization of the posse. Including him,
there were 4 men from Montana, 2 from Idaho, and 10 or 12 recruited in Jackson
Hole. Asked to join the outfit, Cunningham refused, and stayed at Flat Creek. The
posse elected a spokesman, and then started up the valley to the Spread Creek cabin&mdash;a
group of 16 men, all mounted and heavily armed.</p>
<p>Under cover of darkness, the posse approached the cabin, a low, sod-roofed log
building in dark silhouette against the night sky. Silently they surrounded it; 6
men in the shed about 150 yards northwest of the cabin, 3 took cover behind the
ridge about the same distance south of the cabin, and the rest presumably scattered
at intermediate vantage points. And then they waited for dawn.</p>

<br />The Cunningham Cabin, where on an April morning in 1893 two men were
cornered and shot for horse-stealing.</p>
</div>
<p>Inside the cabin the unsuspecting men were sleeping quietly: Spenser, the
older man, sandy-haired and heavily built; Burnett, the cowpuncher, slender and
dark; and of course Swede Jackson, Cunningham&rsquo;s partner. The two rustlers
intended to leave when it got light.</p>
<p>Early in the morning the dog which was in the cabin with the men began to
bark shrilly, perhaps taking alarm at the scent of the posse. Spenser got up, dressed,
buckled on his revolver, and went out to the corral.</p>
<p>The corral lay between the cabin and the shed, and after Spenser had entered
it one of the posse called to him to &ldquo;throw &rsquo;em up.&rdquo; Instead Spenser drew with
lightning speed and fired twice, one bullet passing between two logs and almost
hitting the spokesman, the other nicking a log near by. The posse returned fire and
Spenser fell to the ground, propping himself up on one elbow and continuing to
shoot until he collapsed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Burnett had got up, slipped on his overalls and boots, and fastened
on his revolver. Then he picked up his rifle in his right hand and came out of the
cabin. As he stepped forth, one of the men behind the ridge fired at him. The bullet
struck the point of a log next to the door, just in front of Burnett&rsquo;s eyes. Burnett
swept the splinters from his face with his right hand as he reached for his revolver
with his left, and fired lefthanded at the top of the gunman&rsquo;s hat, just visible over
the ridge. The shot was perfect; the bullet tore away the hat and creased the man&rsquo;s
scalp. He toppled over backwards.</p>
<p>Burnett then deliberately walked over to the corner of the cabin and stopped,
with rifle in hand, in full view of the entire posse, taunting them to come out and
show themselves. From inside the cabin Jackson pleaded with him to come in or he
would get it too. Burnett finally turned, and as he did so one of the members of the
posse shot him. The bullet killed Burnett instantly, and he pitched forward toward
the cabin, discharging his rifle as he fell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Now only Jackson was left in the cabin. A big, bumbling man with a knack
for trouble, Jackson had once before been taken by mistake for a horsethief and
been scared almost to death; when he was now ordered to come out and surrender
with his hands in the air he did so immediately.</p>
<p>The work of the posse was done. Mike Burnett lay face down in the dirt at
the corner of the cabin, the bullet from his last shot lodged in a log beside him;
George Spenser, his six-shooter empty, was sprawled inside the corral with 4
charges of buckshot and 4 or 5 bullets in his body. They were buried in unmarked
graves a few hundred yards southeast of the cabin, on the south side of a draw.</p>
<p>No investigation was ever made, no trial held, and the matter was hushed up.
As years went by the subject of the killing at Spread Creek became a touchy one,
and most of the men directly involved preferred not to talk about it. Swede Jackson,
apparently thoroughly shaken by the incident, left the valley and did not return.
The affair at Cunningham&rsquo;s Ranch was a closed story.</p>
<p>What information the members of the posse did volunteer in later years was
in justification of their actions. The posse leader was a Montana sheriff, they said,
and he and his men had come from Evanston, Wyoming, with the &ldquo;proper papers,&rdquo;
and deputized the Jackson Hole men. According to them there had been no intention
of killing&mdash;the 2 victims had been given a chance to surrender, and after the
affair one of the men in the posse had gone to Evanston to report it to the police.</p>
<p>Those in the valley who had not been in on the posse were not so sure of the
legality of the shooting. Cunningham said he thought the leader was not an officer,
and reiterated that the posse had been instructed not to arrest but to kill. He stated
that 2 local men had previously been asked to dispose of the pair, but had refused.
When asked who raised the posse and investigated the killing, Cunningham laughed
and said he could tell but preferred not to; asked if he cared to state whether the
move was local or not, he quickly said, &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t only local.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cunningham himself was rumored to have warned the outlaws to be on guard,
having returned from the Spread Creek ranch only a short time before the killing.
The story easily gained credence, since Spenser had caught the posse completely by
surprise when he armed himself and started directly for the corral and shed where
the men were hidden. Cunningham denied &ldquo;tipping them off,&rdquo; and Jackson later
said it was unusual for the dog to bark as it did that morning. Spenser probably
sensed from the dog&rsquo;s actions that something was amiss and so put on his gun
before leaving the cabin, a precaution which Jackson said the men had never taken
during the previous winter.</p>
<p>Cunningham seemed more favorably impressed by the behavior of the 2
horsethieves than by any heroism on the part of the posse, an attitude which was
general in the valley. Members of the posse had little to say about it.</p>
<p>In 1928, several years before his death, Pierce Cunningham recounted the
story of the killing at Spread Creek and ended by pointing out the spot where
the rustlers were buried. With 2 timbers he marked the sage-covered plot,
one corner of it crossed by the road then running past the cabin, where George
Spenser and Mike Burnett had lain since their death in 1893.</p>
<p>Years later badgers threw out some of their bones into the sunlight.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">PROSPECTOR OF JACKSON HOLE<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></span>
<br /><span class="smaller">By <span class="sc">Fritiof Fryxell</span></span></h2>
<p>In the 1880&rsquo;s and 1890&rsquo;s it was widely supposed that the Snake River gravels of
Jackson Hole, in Wyoming, contained workable deposits of placer gold, and there
were many who came to the region, lured by such reports and a prospector&rsquo;s
eternal optimism.</p>
<p>Color, indeed, could be struck almost anywhere along the river, but the gold
of which it gave promise proved discouragingly scarce and elusive. None found
what in fairness to the word could be called a fortune. Few found sufficient gold
to maintain for any length of time even the most frugal living&mdash;and who can live
more frugally than the itinerant prospector? So through these decades prospectors
quietly came and sooner or later as quietly left, leaving no traces of their visit
more substantial than the scattered prospect holes still to be seen along the bars
of the Snake River. Even today a prospector occasionally finds his way into the
valley, and, like a ghost out of the past, may be seen on some river bar, patiently
panning. Probably he, too, will drift on. It is apparent now that the wealth of
Jackson Hole lies not in gold-bearing gravels but in the matchless beauty of its
snow-covered hills and the tonic qualities of its mountain air and streams.</p>
<p>But one prospector stayed. Mysterious in life, Uncle Jack Davis has become one
of the most shadowy figures in the past of Jackson Hole, little more than a name
except to those few still left of an older generation who knew him. He deserves
to be remembered&mdash;deserves it because of his singular story, and because he has the
distinction historically of having been the only confirmed prospector in Jackson
Hole.</p>
<p>He was &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; only by courtesy for he lived a lonely hermit until his death;
and so far as is known he left no relatives. He first appeared in 1887 as one of
the throng of miners drawn irresistibly into that maelstrom of the gold excitements,
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Virginia City, Montana. In a Virginia City saloon he became involved in a brawl
and struck a man down, struck him too hard and killed him. Davis, it should
be remarked, was a man of herculean strength and, at the time of this accident,
he was drunk. Believing himself slated for the usual treatment prescribed by
Montana justice at the time&mdash;quick trial and hanging&mdash;he fled the city.</p>
<p>Davis reappeared shortly after this in Jackson Hole, the resort of more than
one man with a past, and in the most isolated corner of that isolated region he
began life anew. At the south end of the Hole, a few miles down the Grand
Canyon, he took out a claim on the south side of the Snake River near a little
tributary known as Bailey Creek. There he built a log cabin, the humblest structure
imaginable&mdash;one room, no windows, a single door hung on rawhide hinges.
This primitive shack was Jack Davis&rsquo; home for nearly a quarter of a century.
True, more than two decades later he built himself a new cabin, but death knocked
at the door of the old one before he could move.</p>

<br />Uncle Jack&rsquo;s cabin was located on the Snake River near the mouth of Bailey
Creek. The plank structure on the roof is the old sluice box which was used
to make his coffin.</p>
</div>
<p>Down in the bottom of this magnificent canyon which he had almost to himself,
Davis plied his old trade of placer mining, putting in the usual crude system of
sluice boxes and ditches. In addition, he cultivated a patch of ground which
yielded vegetables sufficient for his own needs and for an occasional trade.
The income from both sources was ridiculously small, but his needs were modest
enough. Primarily he wished peace and seclusion, and these he found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The Virginia City episode never ceased to trouble him. It made him a
recluse for life. He lived alone, and limited his associates almost entirely to the
few neighbors who, as the years passed, came to share his canyon or that of
the nearby Hoback River. Trips to town were made only when necessary, and were
brief. On such occasions it was his practice to cross the Snake near his cabin
and hike or snowshoe up the west side to the store at Menor&rsquo;s Ferry, 50 miles
distant. Having made his purchases he shouldered them and returned by the
same route. In the course of his journey he saw and talked to few. He rarely
went to Jackson, the only town in the region. He is said to have been a sober man,
afraid of drink.</p>
<p>Davis&rsquo; solitary habits sprang from a haunting fear of pursuit, not from
dislike of companionship. The presence of a stranger in the region made him
uneasy, and he did not rest until his mission was known, sometimes pressing
a friend into service to ascertain a stranger&rsquo;s business. He rarely allowed his
photograph to be taken. Apparently his fears had little foundation, for no one
from &ldquo;outside&rdquo; ever came in after him. Very likely Virginia City soon forgot him.</p>
<p>Davis&rsquo; past was known to only 1 or 2 of the most intimate of his neighbors.
They kept it to themselves. Nor would it have mattered had this story been more
generally known&mdash;not in Jackson Hole where such a distinction was by no means
unique, and where a man was judged for what he was, not for what he had been,
or had done.</p>
<p>Though a strange recluse, he was a man to be admired and respected. Physically
he was tall, broad, of magnificently erect carriage&mdash;a blue-eyed, full-bearded giant.
Stories of his strength still enjoy currency. According to one of these, Uncle Jack
once lifted a casting which on its shipping bill was credited with weighing 900
pounds&mdash;lifted it by slipping a loop of rope under it, passing the loop over his
shoulders, and straightening his back. And it was well known that for all his
solitary habits, Uncle Jack was kind and generous as he was strong.</p>
<p>It seems as though for the remainder of his days Uncle Jack did penance
for his one great mistake. He impressed one as trying hard to do the right thing
by everyone and everything. Such was his love for birds and animals that he
would go hungry rather than shoot them. To callers at his shack he explained
the absence of meat from the table by a stock alibi so lame and transparent that
it fooled no one: &ldquo;He&rsquo;d eat so much meat lately that he&rsquo;d decided to lay off
it for awhile.&rdquo; His unwillingness to kill turned him into a vegetarian&mdash;here
in the midst of the best hunting country in America. A hermit, yet Uncle Jack
was hardly lonely. In birds and beasts of the canyon he found a substitute for
human companionship. The wild creatures about him soon ceased to be wild.
His family of pets included Lucy, a doe who lived with him for many years;
Buster, her fawn, whom the coyotes finally killed; two cats&mdash;Pitchfork Tillman,
named for a prominent political figure of the times, and Nick Wilson, much
given to night life, so named after a prominent pioneer of the valley; and a number
of tame squirrels and bluebirds. Not to mention Dan, the old horse, and Calamity
Jane, the inevitable prospector&rsquo;s burro, which had accompanied Jack in his flight
to Jackson Hole, where it finally died at the advanced age of 40 years. Maintaining
peace in such a family kept Uncle Jack from becoming lonely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Al Austin, who for many years
was forest ranger in this region, and
who in time came to enjoy Uncle
Jack&rsquo;s closest confidence, presents an
unforgettable picture of the old man
and his family. Dropping in at
mealtime for a friendly call, Austin
would find Uncle Jack in his cabin
surrounded by his pets, each clamouring
to be fed and each jealous
of attention bestowed on any creature
other than itself. If the bluebirds
were favored, the squirrels
chattered vociferously. Buster, if irritated,
would justify his name by
charging and upsetting the furniture.
Add to this the audible impatience
of Pitchfork Tillman and
Nick Wilson, Lucy was ladylike but
nevertheless insistent. To this motley
circle Uncle Jack would hold forth
in inimitable language, carrying on
a running stream of conversation&mdash;scolding,
lecturing, admonishing, or
when discord became acute,
threatening dire punishment if they
did not mend their ways. It is
hardly necessary to add that to
Uncle Jack&rsquo;s awful threats, and the
vivid profanity, which it must be
admitted, accompanied them, the
members of the household remained
serenely indifferent, and there is no
record that any of the promised
disasters ever fell on their furry
heads.</p>

<br />Uncle Jack Davis, the only confirmed prospector
of Jackson Hole, was tall, broad, of
magnificently erect carriage&mdash;a blue-eyed, full-bearded
giant. This is a rare photograph taken
shortly before his death.</p>
</div>
<p>Having no windows, Uncle Jack left his door open during the good weather.
One spring a pair of bluebirds flew through the open door into the shack and,
having inspected the place and found it to their liking, built their nest behind
a triangular fragment of mirror which Uncle Jack had stuck on the wall. Uncle
Jack then cut down the door from its leather hinges and did not replace it until
fall. Six successive summers the bluebirds returned to the cabin, and, finding
the door removed in anticipation of their coming, built their nest and raised
their young behind Uncle Jack&rsquo;s mirror.</p>
<p>Nearby Uncle Jack made a little graveyard for his pets, as they left him
one by one. It was lovingly cared for. In the course of the 24 years which he spent
there the burial ground came to contain many neat mounds&mdash;mounds of strangely
different sizes. But Lucy, Pitchfork Tillman, and Dan outlived Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>He would not accept charity, even during the last year or two of his life
when he was nearly destitute. Neighbors had to resort to strategy to get him to
accept help.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>On his periodic trips up and down the canyon, Austin brought the mail
to Davis and to Johnny Counts, who lived next to the north. Counts and Davis,
too, occasionally exchanged visits. On March 14, 1911, Austin called at Counts&rsquo;
and, finding that nothing had been heard of from Uncle Jack for some time,
snowshoed on down the canyon to see if all was well.</p>
<p>The old man lay in bed, delirious. The last date checked off on the wall
calendar was February 11. Outside the cabin, elk had eaten all the hay, and the
horse and Lucy were at the point of starvation. Austin stayed by his bedside for
several days, then, finding it impossible to care for Uncle Jack decently in the
dark old cabin, summoned Counts. Several days later they moved the old man 6
miles up the river, carrying him where they could, most of the way pulling him
along in a boat from the shore. The old trail was one Jack himself had built
many years before. In Count&rsquo;s cabin, a week later, Uncle Jack died.</p>
<p>Austin made Uncle Jack&rsquo;s coffin from one of the old man&rsquo;s own sluice boxes.
Together the two men carried Uncle Jack to the grave they had dug for him at
Sulphur Springs, nearby in the canyon. A wooden headboard on which Ranger
Austin carved the inscription, &ldquo;A. L. Davis, Died March 25, 1911,&rdquo; marks the
grave&mdash;there Uncle Jack sleeps alone.</p>
<p>In Davis&rsquo; shack was found the &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; which placer mining had brought
him&mdash;$12 in cash and about the same value in gold amalgam.</p>

<br />THE STORY OF MENOR&rsquo;S FERRY
<br /><span class="smaller">By <span class="sc">Frances Judge</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t W. D. Menor talking, this is H. H. Menor talking, by God.
Holy Saviour, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Bill and Holiday carried a mouthful of oaths that spilled out whenever
they spoke. They cursed their friends and neighbors, they cursed each other,
and they cursed themselves. But to lighten this burden of words when women
were around, Holiday would say, before a sentence, in the middle of a sentence
or at the end of one, &ldquo;Holy Savior, yes!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Holy Savior, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill never bothered to lighten his profanity.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of cursing, they were men of dignity.</p>
<p>Everyone in Jackson Hole knew Bill and Holiday Menor. They were as much
a part of the country as the Snake River or the Teton Mountains. The type of men
they were brought them here.</p>
<p>Then, as now, Jackson Hole had a marked collection of people. They were
unshackled and they had color. Strength was intensified. Weakness was vivid.
Bill and Holiday were plain spoken, strong-dyed individualists. They belonged
here.</p>
<p>The Menor brothers came originally from Ohio. They were tall men. Bill,
11 years older than his brother, was thin and long-boned. His nose and sharp
eyes were like an old eagle&rsquo;s. Holiday&rsquo;s long body sagged a little. He had a
grizzled beard, long, shrewd nose, and amused, gray eyes. He prospected in Montana
before coming to Jackson Hole. &ldquo;My partner&rsquo;s name was Mean, but I was
Menor,&rdquo; he would say. He claimed to have made over one hundred and twenty
thousand dollars in one prospect. When asked what happened to the money, he
always said, &ldquo;Wine, women and song.&rdquo; He talked of going off to Old Mexico,
prospecting, but he never went. There was too much living to be done on the
banks of the Snake River.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Bill Menor, coming to this valley in 1892, settled on a homestead by squatter&rsquo;s
right. He settled where the Snake River hauls toward the great mountains. He was
first to homestead on the west bank of the Snake River, under the Tetons. He
built a low, log house among the cottonwoods on the shore of the river, collected
a cow or two, and a horse; a few chickens; plowed up sage and made a field; planted
a garden; built a blacksmith shop; and in time opened a small store where he
sold a few groceries, a lot of Bull Durham, overalls, tin pans, fish hooks and
odds and ends.</p>
<p>And he immediately constructed a ferry to ply the unreliable Snake. Before
settling in the valley, he spent 10 days with John Shive and John Cherry &ldquo;on
the Buffalo.&rdquo; At that time he considered establishing a ferry somewhere along
the Buffalo, but after talking with Cherry and Shive, he decided on the Snake
River. And his decision was wise and farsighted.</p>
<p>Many settlers cut timber on Bill&rsquo;s side of the river, so the ferry was welcome.
There were times when it was the only crossing within a 40 mile stretch up and
down the river. Once in awhile there was no crossing at all, when the river was &ldquo;in
spate&rdquo; and Bill refused to risk the ferry. At such a time people were forced to go
up one side of the river to Moran, cross the toll bridge, and travel down the
other side&mdash;80 miles to travel 8.</p>
<p>The ferry, a railed platform on pontoons, was carried directly across the
river by the current, guided by ropes attached to an overhead cable. The cable
was secured to a massive log&mdash;called a &ldquo;dead man.&rdquo; The ferry was large enough
to carry a 4-horse team, provided the lead team was unhooked and led to the side
of the wagon.</p>

<br />Menor&rsquo;s Ferry at about the turn of the Century. Where the mad Snake rolls by,
and the shadow of the great mountains moves over sage, and building, and river.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Bill Menor charged 50 cents for a team, 25 cents for a horse and rider. A
foot passenger was carried free if a vehicle was crossing.</p>
<p>In those early days almost everyone who came to cross the ferry around
mealtime was invited to eat. If the river was too high for safe crossing and the
persons who wanted to cross were in no particular hurry, Bill would keep them
2 or 3 days, bedding them and feeding them generously until the waters subsided,
and charging them only the slim ferry fee. &ldquo;When you see them rollers in the
middle of the river, I won&rsquo;t cross,&rdquo; he would say, apologizing in his grouchy way
for keeping people around.</p>
<p>Anyone who stayed with Bill had to be washed and combed and ready to leap
at the table at twelve-noon and six-sharp. Early in the morning, as soon as the fire
was built, he yelled at them, saying, &ldquo;Come on, get out of bed. Don&rsquo;t lay there
until the flies blow you!&rdquo; Nothing angered him more than to have someone late
for a meal, unless it was to put a dish or a pan in the wrong place. Bill had a place
for everything and everything had to be in place. Once the Roy VanVlecks spent
the night with Bill. They washed the morning dishes before ferrying over the
river. Bill, leaning against the kitchen doorcasing, criticized and cursed because
the frying pans shouldn&rsquo;t go here and the kettles shouldn&rsquo;t go there. Yet he did
not offer to put them on their proper nails or even show where they belonged.</p>
<p>That was Bill, and his neighbors understood. He was a man boiled down
to his primary colors.</p>
<p>Bill was generally accommodating, but if he were particularly out of humor,
and had a natural distaste for a person who came along after six in the evening,
he would refuse to ferry him over the river or keep him for the night. He apparently
got satisfaction out of being downright mean to a few individuals.</p>
<p>When the Snake is high, it is ferocious. It boils, seethes, growls, beats its
breast, and carries with it everything it can reach.</p>
<p>Once it got Bill.</p>
<p>A huge, uprooted tree swept against the ferry with such force that the ropes
broke and the boat was carried downstream, taking Bill with it. After a quick
trip, the ferry grounded on a submerged sandbar. Neighbors gathered and conferred
and hurried about, trying to rescue Bill. He stood on the ferry violently
cursing the rescue crew and acting, in general, as though they alone were to blame
for the high water and his predicament.</p>
<p>Holiday Menor came to Jackson Hole about 1905. He lived for a number
of years with his brother, Bill. But the disposition of each was cut on the bias, and
the two disagreed over a neighbor. So Holiday took up land on the east shore and
built his houses directly across from brother Bill, and let the river run between
them. Like a great many individualists, Bill and Holiday considered strong
hate a mark of character, so they did not speak to each other for 2 years. Nevertheless,
they were proud of each other, and the name of one always cropped up in
the conversation of the other, mixed well with curses. And each watched across
the river for the other, to make sure all was right on the opposite shore.</p>
<p>One Christmas the brothers were invited to the Bar B C Ranch for dinner.
It was Holiday&rsquo;s birthday. Neither knew the other was to be there. When each
arrived he was given a strong drink of whiskey to insure amiability. The 2
brothers shook hands over the Christmas table. Ever after they were on speaking
terms.</p>
<p>And sometimes they spoke too freely, shaking fists and cursing each other
over the river. There was much gusto in their living.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Though Bill read hardly more than the daily paper that came to him, Holiday
subscribed to a number of magazines. He read 7 long months of the year and
&ldquo;talked it out&rdquo; the other 5. He argued politically with everyone, whether they
would argue or not. &ldquo;Now, mind you, I&rsquo;m telling you, this ain&rsquo;t W. D. talking,
this is H. H. Menor talking, by God.&rdquo; And for emphasis he would bang things
with a stick of stove wood. Once he came down on the red hot stove with his
bare fist and for a short while political views were unimportant.</p>
<p>Gradually the land was taken up by a homesteader or Government leaser,
and the Menors were surrounded with neighbors. Then, as now, persons living
10 or 15 miles away were considered close neighbors. Everybody in the valley
knew everybody else, or at least knew stories about him. For Holiday to have
a close neighbor other than Bill was intriguing. Mrs. Evelyn Dorman, a Pennsylvania
woman, homesteaded on the east bank, and her buildings were only a quarter
of a mile below Holiday&rsquo;s. She called him the Patriarch of the Ford, and he called
her the Widow down the River.</p>
<p>To have Mrs. Dornan ask how he prepared some dish filled him with pride.
He enjoyed giving away his recipes. He would say, &ldquo;You take two handfuls of
flour, that is, and a pinch of salt, that is ...&rdquo; All his recipes were generously
seasoned with &ldquo;that is&rsquo;s&rdquo;. He was an excellent cook and loved to have his friends
eat with him.</p>
<p>But there was the rooster episode.</p>
<p>Bill had a beautiful barred Plymouth Rock rooster; a huge single-combed
domestic fowl with graceful feathers in its tail, and pride in its walk. But
Holiday&rsquo;s rooster had only two feathers in its tail, its body was completely bare,
and it had no pride.</p>
<p>It was a sad sight.</p>
<p>The Widow down the River laughed every time she looked at Holiday&rsquo;s rooster
and wanted to take a picture of it. But Holiday said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Savior, no! I don&rsquo;t want that rooster shown as an example of what is
raised on my ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearing Mrs. Dornan would take a picture of the fowl, he killed it, cooked it,
and invited her to eat it with him. He never once thought that the bird might have
been defeathered by disease. Mrs. Dorman ate rooster and pretended to enjoy
it. She was an understanding neighbor.</p>
<p>Both Bill and Holiday raised excellent gardens. To be fairly safe against frost
they never planted until the snow melted up to a certain level in the Tetons. They
raised many vegetables. Their cauliflowers were as big as footstools. They raised
currents and raspberries galore, and made jelly and jam. And they raised flowers.
Holiday always had pansies on the north side of his buildings. He called them
tansies. He and Bill always gave freely of their vegetables, berries, and flowers.</p>
<p>During the wild berry season, Bill would charge &ldquo;huckleberry rates&rdquo; to the
local people&mdash;fare one way only&mdash;when the berries were ripe along the ridges and
around the lakes under the Tetons.</p>
<p>Holiday would can between 50 and 60 quarts of huckleberries during a season.
And since he drank periodically he made wine. At any rate that is what he called
it. He would make it of berries, raisins, prunes, beets, plus whatever else was handy&mdash;and
never wait for the mixture to mature.</p>
<p>It would knock his hat off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>At five one summer morning, neighbors stopped at Holiday&rsquo;s returning from
a dance. They were cold. They needed a stimulant, but Holiday had no wine. He
had drunk it all. So they drank a cocktail made of gin and huckleberry juice&mdash;half
and half. After finishing their drinks, 2 young men in the party decided to go shoot
a rabbit for breakfast. They did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shot it right in the eye,&rdquo; one said, holding up what was left of the
rabbit.</p>
<p>The hind parts were shot away, slick as a whistle.</p>
<p>That is what gin and wild huckleberry juice did to a rabbit. Holy Savior, yes!
What might Holiday&rsquo;s wine have done to it?</p>
<p>Holiday enjoyed the summer visitors in Jackson Hole. Bill probably enjoyed
them also, but they could not lift him from his natural state of grouchiness. Once,
after looking over the miles of sage that covered the levels of land that rise from
the river to the mountains, an Eastern lady said to Bill, &ldquo;Mr. Menor, what do you
raise in this country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill, a dyed-in-the-wool bachelor, looked at her and said, &ldquo;Hell and kids
and plenty of both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He enjoyed startling people.</p>
<p>And he apparently knew what the &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; thought of a Jackson Holer. In
1915 he made a trip to the World&rsquo;s Fair with his neighbors, Jim and Mary Budge.
When they had boarded a San Francisco-bound train, after a strenuous trek out of
Jackson Hole, both Jim and Bill felt in need of a long drink of whiskey. Entering
the smoker with their concealed bottle, they found one other man there. They
did not like his looks and they felt no need of him. Bill walked up and looked
down at him with his eagle stare. &ldquo;Do you know where we&rsquo;re from?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;JACKSON HOLE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man made a quick escape.</p>
<p>Though Holiday was more jovial than Brother Bill, his neighbors steered
clear of him when he was in the process of making lime. He made and sold lime
to neighboring ranchers. Some of them, like Bill, whitewashed their houses inside
and out with it. Holiday chinked his houses with it. He also used it as a cure-all for
man and beast. When he made lime he had to keep a steady fire going for thirty-odd
hours in the kiln just behind the house in the bank. During these hours he
was not fit company for man or beast. But his neighbors accepted his limy disposition
as a necessary part of the process. Holy Savior, yes. What of it?</p>
<p>When late fall brought bitter winds, heavy fogs, and snow, the ferry was
beached for the winter. From then on all teams had to ford the river. A little platform
was hung from the river cable to accommodate foot passengers. It would hold
3 or 4 at one time. The passengers mounted the platform from a ladder and sat
down. Bill released the car; with a quick swoosh it ran down the slack in the cable
where it dipped within 10 feet of the river. Then the frightened passengers would
laboriously haul themselves up the relaxed cable to the opposite shore.</p>
<p>In later years, when travel became heavier, a winter bridge was flung across the
main channel. Putting in the winter bridge was the responsibility of everyone,
friend and enemy alike. When the time was ripe, word was sent to nearby ranchers.
On this day of days all cars and wagons were stopped and the occupants asked
to help with the construction. If they protested, Holiday would say, &ldquo;Do you want
to use the winter bridge? Well, then help put it in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Giving a hot meal to the crew that laid the winter bridge became traditional
with Mrs. Dornan. While they carried logs and hammered, she baked and fried and
boiled.</p>
<p>To find a crew to lay the winter bridge was never very difficult, but to find
a few who were willing to help remove it in the spring was a very different matter.
The ferry was running full blast. No one needed the bridge. No one was enthusiastic.
This was spring; time to plant and build and plan. No time to tear down.
To get men to the river for this seemingly useless task was worse than trying to get
a fresh cow on the ferry without her calf.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that one spring there was only Holiday and one other man
to move the bridge pole by pole, nail by nail, oath by oath. As a result any log
that looked too heavy for 2 men to lift was rolled into the river. &ldquo;To hell with it,&rdquo;
Holiday would say, and dust off his hands. &ldquo;Holy Savior, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1918, Bill sold his ranch and the ferry. The new owners raised the prices.
Soon after the ferry changed hands, a Jackson Holer came along on foot. Finding
the fare doubled he leaped, fully dressed and full of anger into the Snake River and
swam across. The pilot stood on the ferry, cursing the swimmer and yelling that he
hoped he would drown.</p>
<p>Bill sold because he had enough of high water and low water. He had enough
of fog, rain, wind, snow, and sunshine on the Snake.</p>
<p>Yet he could not drag himself away. He hung around his house and at twelve-noon,
and six-sharp he would pace what was no longer his floor and swear because
the meal was not ready. Mrs. Dornan, who was then boarding at the Menor place,
would get him to the door and say, &ldquo;Go on out, Bill. The meal will be good when
you get it.&rdquo; But this was no longer home. At last he dragged himself away from
the ranch, away from the valley. He moved to California.</p>
<p>In 1925 the Gros Ventre slide occurred which brought tourists flocking to
Jackson Hole. The great rump of Sheep Mountain had dropped away, damming
the Gros Ventre River and forming a lake 4 miles long. This landslide occurred
directly across the valley from Menor&rsquo;s Ferry and brought the owners a landslide
of business. But Bill had sold and left the country.</p>
<p>By 1927 a huge bridge spanned the Snake not far from the Menor houses, so
the ferry was beached and in time dismantled. But before the bridge was completed,
Holiday had sold his land and followed his brother to California.</p>
<p>Now they were old men.</p>
<p>Just before leaving the valley, Holiday bought a new suit and a new hat. He
stayed a few days in Jackson at the Crabtree Hotel. One night, while he was in
town, the ladies of some organization were having a dinner in the Club House&mdash;the
upper floor of a huge frame building. An outside stairway led up to the hall.
Holiday happened along just as a woman stepped out on the stairway with a pan
full of dishwater. She threw the water all over him. Holiday walked on to the
hotel, wet and violently angry. After a string of oaths that would reach from
one end of the Snake River to the other and all its tributaries, he said to Mrs.
Crabtree, &ldquo;A man gets dressed up once in 17 years and a woman has to climb up
above him and throw dishwater all over him. Why couldn&rsquo;t it have been a minute
earlier or a minute later? Hell!&rdquo; And he stomped off to his room.</p>
<p>Shortly before Bill&rsquo;s death, Mrs. Dornan found the two brothers in San Diego,
in a little hospital on Juniper Street. Bill was bedridden, but his mind was keen.
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
He cursed the bed in which he lay, and talked of Jackson Hole. A sympathetic
nurse had pinned on the wall at the foot of his bed a crude oil painting of the
Teton Mountains.</p>
<p>Holiday was able to be up and about, but his mind had begun to fade. Mrs.
Dornan took him mahogany &ldquo;tansies&rdquo; like those he once grew. Knowing he would
never see her again, he gave her a handkerchief with his initials in one corner.
H. H. M.</p>
<p>She knew that never again would she hear him say, &ldquo;Now mind you, I&rsquo;m
telling you. This ain&rsquo;t W. D. Menor talking, this is H. H. Menor talking, by God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brothers died within a year of each other.</p>
<p>But living or dead they belonged to Jackson Hole. They were vivid, strong-grained
men.</p>
<p>Holiday&rsquo;s buildings are gone. But Bill&rsquo;s low, whitewashed house still stands.</p>
<p>And the mad Snake rolls by, and the shadow of the great mountains moves
over sage, and building, and river.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
